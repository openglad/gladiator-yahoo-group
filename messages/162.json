See\nthere is a demo available which you can download and play for FREE(which\nmight suit you well since cheapness seems to be your chief quality).  Now,\nif you like the demo enough and want more, then you pay for the full\nversion, thereby encouraging the author to keep making it better.  This\nconcept would work very poorly however if the world only consisted of\ndishonest scum who think everything should be given to them and  won&#39;t pay\neven a small amount of money for a quality product.  If you&#39;re really\ninterested in free stuff, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re running the wrong OS.  But then,\nmost of the games are written for MS operating systems  which is really too\nbad.\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &lt;Patrik85@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@onelist.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 17, 1999 11:22 PM\nSubject: [gladiator] Re:Gladiators\n\n\nFrom: Patrik85@...\n\nDear greedy guys.....!!!!!!!!!!!!\nYou pathetic #&quot;�&quot;#%�&#�%/��%#�%&quot;.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI would have given anyone of the code if i had it and someone of you\nasked....\nYou are pathetic....\nand egoistic fools....\nYou would not even help a poor child on the street.......\nYou &quot;!�!&quot;%&quot;#%&&quot;�%/.\nI would have given it to anyone of you,... you\n&quot;!%&quot;%!&&/)%&�%&quot;&@$��$@......!!!!!\nYou are egoistic......you !&quot;�!&quot;#%!#�%!/.....!!!!!!!!!!!\nYou greedy &quot;�%!#:!#��$${@�!#%!#�%�$�$@!#�%!#�%�$......!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
