Mana would be regenerated at half \nspeed during that period.  You could still defend yourself, but your \nopponents would have an advantage.\n\nOf course, another alternative is rewriting the code so that a team \ncan only wipe so many health points on each opponent while time is \nfrozen.\n\n\n"}}
