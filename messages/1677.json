Worse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem: there are 8 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; teams in the scenario and each one has a mage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of slowing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; down \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time.  How would that problem be handled?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another thing to consider is making the time\n&gt; slow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down delay before \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; using it again effect the entire team.  What\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; team 1 had 3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mages?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Effectively, team 1 could rotate out who slows\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down time to keep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indefinitely frozen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To avoid the problem of 8 different teams with\n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowdown ability, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe thay should ALL have it disabled for a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes after a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowdown.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I see no reason for _any_ delay at all. If you\n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; three high-level magi and the enemy only has one,\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; _should_ be able to take advantage of your\n&gt; abundance\n&gt; &gt; of magi. (If you didn&#39;t switch to Archmage for a\n&gt; &gt; reason, that reason usually is Freeze Time.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; &gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
