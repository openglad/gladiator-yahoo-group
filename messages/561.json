Let me see if I can find\n&gt; that documentation ....\n&gt; \n&gt; Okay, the scenario files evolved up through version\n&gt; 8 .. I&#39;ll get you the \n&gt; code for that, since it&#39;s the most recent; if you\n&gt; need the earlier versions \n&gt; for any reason (you shouldn&#39;t, since you can always\n&gt; just load an older \n&gt; version in the editor, and re-save it to update it\n&gt; to version 8), let me know.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the file description information (you might\n&gt; want to view/print this \n&gt; in a monospaced font):\n&gt; \n&gt;    // Format of a scenario object list file version\n&gt; 6/7+ is:\n&gt;    // 3-byte header: &#39;FSS&#39;\n&gt;    // 1-byte version #\n&gt;    // 8-byte string = grid name to load\n&gt;    // 30-byte scenario title (ver 6+)\n&gt;    // 1-byte char = scenario type, default is 0\n&gt;    // 2-bytes par-value, v.8+\n&gt;    // 2-bytes (short) = total objects to follow\n&gt;    // List of n objects, each of 7-bytes of form:\n&gt;           // 1-byte ORDER\n&gt;           // 1-byte FAMILY\n&gt;           // 2-byte short xpos\n&gt;           // 2-byte short ypos\n&gt;           // 1-byte TEAM\n&gt;           // 1-byte facing\n&gt;           // 1-byte command\n&gt;           // 1-byte level // 2 bytes in version 7+\n&gt;           // 12-bytes name\n&gt;           // ---\n&gt;           // 10 bytes reserved\n&gt;    // 1-byte # of lines of text to load\n&gt;    // List of n lines of text, each of form:\n&gt;           // 1-byte character width of line\n&gt;           // m bytes == characters on this line\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me know if you need more information!\n&gt; \n&gt; --Tom\n&gt; \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nGet personalized email addresses from Yahoo!
