Maybe in a similiar game with a science fiction \n&gt;theme.\n&gt;  A robot would just look out of place among elementals and archers and \n&gt;other\n&gt;fantasy creatures.  I also thought of a promotion.  A druid could become a\n&gt;Sorceror sometime that could summon special forest creatures like wolfs and\n&gt;bears and whatever.\n\nI&#39;m sure we&#39;re all fimilar with the AD&D ruleset. Maybe we could borrow \nideas from there? Perhaps a high level druid could, instead of summoning \nforest creatures, polymorph into them himself. Also, another spell worthy of \na druid would be chain lightning. Everyone knows druids are in close contact \nwith nature, and how does nature demonstarte her destructivness more than \nlightning? Unless someone wants to program a tornado.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
