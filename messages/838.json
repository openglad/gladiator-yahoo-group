I believe it has something to do with it&#39;s state and who \nplanted\n&gt; it, but I&#39;m not sure (it was in a previous message when someone \nasked about\n&gt; some odd error that popped up in game).\n\nThat was me [a long time ago] about leaving something in the scenario \nthat didn&#39;t belong.  I&#39;ve tried leaving (high level) faerie sprinkles \non slime and they&#39;ve had no effect and not caused error messages.  I&#39;m \nconvinced that you shouldn&#39;t be allowed to plant weapons in a scenario \n if they&#39;re not going to do any good.  Perhaps, Tom Ricket might be \nable to explain how we could plant weapons in a scenario and those \nweapons do something.\n\nIncidently, I&#39;ll be starting the Adoption of Proposed Tournament Rules \ntomorrow.\n\n\n\n"}}
