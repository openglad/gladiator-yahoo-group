I&#39;ve written\r\nout a basic outline of how the rules would work\r\non my own, and would be happy to organize it, but\r\nI need to know if anyone would participate.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d also like to have assistance by people in\r\nmaking the maps specifically for the tournament.\r\nI&#39;m thinking the first tournament set can consist\r\nof 3-5 levels, then we can release different\r\nmapsets, all of which will have to be started with\r\na brand new gladiator team.\r\n\r\nWinning would mean you had the highest valued team\r\nof anyone--a valuation system I still haven&#39;t\r\ndevised, but I think it would work like 100 coins\r\nper level per warrior, 200 coins per level per\r\nmage--and work out like that.  These coins, as\r\nwell as your bare coin value combined with the\r\nlevel you&#39;re on would be used to determine your\r\npoint stand on some kind of online ladder, that\r\ncould either be posted on the main FSGames page\r\nor on my page.  (FSGames could just link to it\r\nthen.)\r\n\r\nTell me what you guys think...\r\n\r\n-Chris\n\n\n\n"}}
