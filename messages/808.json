It won&#39;t accept non-version 8 files, and non-scenario files\neither, so don&#39;t try feeding it those :)\n\nAnyway, have fun with it!\n\nThe last thing I&#39;ve got a question (probably best if Tom could answer\nthis) - the information we were given has the Scenario Type as a character,\nand George said it was either a 0 or 1 in the files he checked - but 0 and 1\ndon&#39;t actually represent characters, so shouldn&#39;t they be stored as bytes (I\nknow the difference isn&#39;t much).\nFor printing out I treat it as a short int (sprintf doesn&#39;t have a byte\nformat specifier...) rather than a character so you can actually see it,\notherwise it&#39;d be blank.\n\nCya,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
