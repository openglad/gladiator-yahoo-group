It is not like there is nothing \nto talk about.  I can think of quite a few questions to be or have \nbeen posed that almost everyone should have a comment about.\n\nExamples:\nWhat kind of scenario that is not out there would you like to see?\nWhich gladiator character is the best?  why?\nWhat team is the best for handling any kind of scenario?\n\nI have general question:  when you finish all the scenarios that are \nshipped with the registered version of gladiator, what is the\n*lowest* \n experience level that any member of your team has?  I need to know \nbecause of plans for the scenarios I am working on.\n\n\n"}}
