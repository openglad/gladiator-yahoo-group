I am serious about limits to prevent omnipotent \ncharacters.  2nd, I beat the ocean by freezing time with my mage.  I \nstill have not figured how that worked.  3rd, my mega-archmage can \nsummon fire elementals that can not be harmed.  Theoritically, I could \ncontinously teleport and be unharmed in the ocean until I find one \nspot to land.\n\n4th, there is a big difference between my levels and Tryx:  you can \nnavigate all of my levels without relying on ghosts, mages, or \narchmages.  All of the levels have reasonably packed enemies.  At no \npresent time, any player is severely in trouble if they follow the \nmain path (ie. Archer encampment and Slime Lords are off the path) \nbecause of being outnumbered.  I redid my first scenario [translation: \n made it easier] because my team was overwhelmed at the start.\n\nActually, I have a theory about how much armor an archer needs to \nprotect himself.  Multiply the strength of the archer times the \nexperience level of the archer and use the result as the minimum \nrecommended amount of armor.  Of course, I have to test against a \nmega-archer.\n\nI would put my illegitimate mega-archmage up against anything except \npowerfull mages [because they could freee time continiously and wipe \nanybody out that way], no matter how outnumbered or how powerfull the \nopponents are (even against an experience level 400 anything, an \nindestructible fire elemental with unlimited can take it out).  \nConsidering that he can summon indestructible fire elementals, all one \nwould need do is summon a few fire elementals and then continiously \nteleport.\n\nI have a working theory that high-experience and high intelligence \nlevel mage could take anything out, if you had the time to spend \n(hours and days).  Just keep time frozen.  Also, by freezing time, you \ncan prevent archmages from overloading your computer with chain \nlightning.  Playing my scenarios is ONLY advised if you have a fast \nprocessor and lots and lots of RAM if you intend on using \nchain-lightning.\n\nHeck, I thought I tested everything on my own scenarios and realized I \nmade a few mistakes.\n\n\n"}}
