What\nI\n&gt; want to know is why we need a new editor.\n\nWell I belive the purpose of the new editor is simply to make it simpler to\nuse and provide extra features.\nEverything may well be possible with the existing editors, and from the\nfeature list I&#39;ve got we are not actually adding much extra, however the\nthing is there are 2 files, their interface requires a lot of time to learn\nand there are a collection of things that can be done to speed up scenario\ncreation.\n\nIf the interface was easier to use then people that thought &quot;Hey it&#39;d be\ncool to write a scenario about blah blah blah...&quot; could fire it up, follow a\ncouple of tutorials and experiment and produce something.\nThe time-saving features mean that more experienced people can produce more\nfaster, can afford to make more mistakes, and can update their scenarios,\nand don&#39;t have to worry so much about (re-)numbering - which, as I gather,\nis rather painful and time-consuming to do at the moment.\n\n&gt; The only problems I have with the\n&gt; old two is that I can&#39;t use a wide range of punctuation in the text.\nPeriod,\n&gt; comma, apostrophe. That&#39;s it. Enough to drive a writer insane, I tell\nyou...\nIs this an editor limitation or a game limitation?  It seems odd you can&#39;t\nuse any character you want but there may be restrictions in the game itself\n:)\nIf theres no in-game limitations then I&#39;ll add these to the feature list.\nBTW - Since we have the scenario file format you may actually be able to\ndirectly edit the files, find the string/s, and stick your punctuation in :)\n\n&gt; If I could access my oh-so-beloved quotation marks, exclamation points,\n&gt; question marks, parentheses, dashes, colons, semicolons, and ampersands,\n&gt; then I&#39;d be happier than a pig in slop. Everything else I can do, and\n&gt; everyone on the list can figure it out with a little practice.\nTrue, but not everyone has, or wants, to spend the time to learn it, and it\nserves as a rather large &#39;entry-barrier&#39; to new scenario designers.\nAfter all, my total experience with it is opening it up, pressing some\nbuttons, messing the screen up, wondering why it was rather hard to use, and\nexiting :)\nGuess I&#39;m too used to the Warcraft 2 and Starcraft editors...\n\n&gt; Now, if some\n&gt; fella was talking of applying his coding skills to the completion of\nBeyond\n&gt; Freedom, I&#39;d be behind him one hundred percent. I&#39;d help out, to the best\nof\n&gt; my ability, and plug away at new scenario design as fast as my\n&gt; keyboard-ravaged fingers could manage. Not to rain on anyone&#39;s parade, but\n&gt; it seems to me that people are getting ready to invest a whole hell of a\nlot\n&gt; of time to a slightly unnecessary and probably unpopular project, when it\nis\n&gt; in our grasp to create something as nifty and stable as Warcraft II. So:\nif\n&gt; we have coders and time and space and permission, why are we not going for\n&gt; the gold?\nThere&#39;s a couple of problems with going directly for something like Beyond\nFreedom.\na)  We don&#39;t have permission, there may be real legal barriers to getting\npermission (though I doubt they have any publishing agreements yet), FS may\nwant to finish it at some point, they may not want to release the code, etc,\netc.\nb)  We don&#39;t seem to have a top-notch set of coders here, games are large\ncomplicated things and the existing code has to be analysed as well, which\ninvolves knowledge of whatever graphics subsystem they were using (I think\nit might be directX, but Dependancy Walker is no longer on this machine so I\ncan&#39;t check...will do that tomorrow) along with just general knowledge.\nc)  We also have no idea how we will work as a team, if it will work at all,\nor how any of this is going to turn out - nobody yet has volunteered to lead\nthe project, so jumping to something big would not be very wise :)\n\nWhat you will probably find is once the scenario editor is built we can move\nto other things.\nAll the above problems then become solved (aside from permission) and we\nalso have something to demonstrate to FS to show what we can do.  Perhaps\nthen we can move onto Beyond Freedom if we are allowed, and even though it\nwould still be a huge task we would be much better equiped to carry it out\n:)\n\nAnyways those are just my thoughts, and it&#39;s 1am so they may not be entirely\ncoherant.\nOf course, if a big bunch of people would rather do Beyond Freedom then I\ncan&#39;t stop it, and I would still help with it, I&#39;m just trying to get across\nthat the technique for learning to program &quot;Start with something small and\nwork your way up&quot; definitely applies to this situation.  I don&#39;t know what\nexperience people on the group have with game design and development and to\nwhat extent they can support/rebuff my comments however I&#39;ve done more than\na little work - the most major of which is not visible on my site simply\nbecause I got a small way into it and found that I&#39;d need a lot more\nknowledge and a lot more time to do it (essence of the game was a\nmultiplayer online RPG), and even some of my smaller ideas have fallen over\nthemselves - I aim too high :)\n\nAh well, I&#39;m off to get some sleep, sleep is gooood.\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n- Who didn&#39;t proof read this like he really should have :)\n\n\n"}}
