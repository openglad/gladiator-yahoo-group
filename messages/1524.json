What I am talking about\n&gt; is randomly placing objects on an existing map, with controls about\n&gt; what type of objects are placed and the level numbers of said objects.\n\nIf we&#39;re going to do that, we might as well go for the whole terrain\ngeneration, too. There are some opensource algorithms out there (we\ncould start from Freeciv&#39;s).\n\n&gt; I don&#39;t even want to think about considering a creating a computer\n&gt; program capable of generating the entire map and placing all objects\n&gt; on that map at random when we don&#39;t have the capacity to export\n&gt; scenario maps into jpg or gif files.  Is anyone actually working on\n&gt; making that capacity a reality?\n\nWe don&#39;t really need that ability to generate mapshots, but it would be\npretty easy to add. As long as you have the RGB values for the palette\ntable (the code still mostly thinks in 8-bit color, even though it draws\nin 32 bit), you can easily create an SDL_Surface with the image (using\nthe bitmap the game uses for graphics) and then do what Niall described\nto write it to a file. It could actually be added with about a dozen\nlines of code to the scenario editor (or to any other part of the code\nfor that matter). It shouldn&#39;t take too much time to figure out and write.\n\nAnyways, that&#39;s not really necessary for level generation. We just need to\ngenerate the terrain and the dudes.\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
