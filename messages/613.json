For example, I decided to change all the \ncharacters into characters from zelda, because it&#39;s a classic.  So i changed \nthe soldier to look like Link, the fairy to look like a fairy :), the golem \nto look like ganon, etc.  It was a lot of fun, esp. after i was finished \nediting the whole thing.  I don&#39;t know if the ppl at FSGames care if I do \nthis or not (i hope not), but i just wanted to make the game a little more \ninteresting... like Red Link killing Green Link, whose then in turn killed by \nBlue Ganon, who then gets frozen in retaliation by Red Fairy... it&#39;s really \nfun.\n\nTristan\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"}}
