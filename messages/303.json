I guess that means that in all of \nthe membership of this list, only 5 are truly devoted.\n\nOther - This are small suggestions:  \n\ngive mages the ability to slow down time for times as an alternate to \nfreezing time.  that way you could still generate energy to use while \nfighting opponents.\n\nAnother suggestion would be adding a new character class:  a\ncharacter \nthat can duplicate the specials of other characters, both friend and \nfoe on the battlefield.  The only exception would be it can not \nduplicate slimes&#39;s ability.  That would make the game more \ninteresting.\n\nAlso, can you give faeries the ability to carry other characters \nacross distances?\n\nCan you give mages the ability to create teleporters to spots where \nwhey have laid a teleport marker?\n\n\n"}}
