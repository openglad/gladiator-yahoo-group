A while back I \n&gt; tried playing around with the editor and didn&#39;t really have any \n&gt; success -- does the text version make it easier?\n\nThe scenario converter program converts the scenario file (*.fss) into \n text (that can be edited using any text editor) and can convert text \nthat is properly formatted into a scenario file (*.fss).\n\nThe text editor is about supplementing the existing scenario editor.  \nI have found usefull (and faster) in raising and lower level numbers, \nbut it&#39;s not a good idea to create a scenario from stratch just using \nthe scenario converter.  It&#39;s NOT a good idea to use the scenario \nconverter to edit storyline for a scenario; that&#39;s too tricky to avoid \ngetting too many spaces.\n\nOnly 1 text editor program is 100% functional and it&#39;s not mine [gotta \nfinish it up and work out bugs].\n\nHopefully tonight or tomorrow, I&#39;ll have a completed storylien ready \nfor each scenario in the 50 Project (halfway through breaking down the \nstoryline for each scenario).\n\n\n"}}
