Is \n&gt;there anything that the tournament scenarios should \nNOT like? [Members \n&gt; of the tournament group can participate in this, \nbut need to keep \n&gt;tournament group secrets SECRET.]\n\nI expect the scenarios to be quality, and I expect \nthe builders to exercise some caution when \nconsidering balance.  Just because your scenario \ndoesn&#39;t end up yielding the most in silver and gold \ndoesn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t the most enjoyable to play.\n\nI&#39;m also not a big fan of your standard mazes... \nsomething about walking through piles upon piles of \nthe same two textures just doesn&#39;t appeal to me.\n\nWhat I&#39;d like to see the builders do is collaborate \non a story that makes sense, and have each scene - \nno matter how small - concentrate on pieces of this \nstory.  One of the coolest parts about playing \nGladiator, to me, is reading the scenario \nintroductions.  It irks me when these introductions \nare poorly written, non-existent or completely \nuninteresting and uninformative.\n\n&gt;Also, considering the tournament is only 20 \nscenarios long, what type \n&gt;of teams are you considering?  Remember: every team \nhas to have at \n&gt;least 4 members.\n\nIf 20 scenarios is an &#39;only,&#39; consider the \nfollowing:  a team of five people will require each \nmember to pump out FOUR quality scenarios.  I don&#39;t \nknow about you guys, but it takes me a few tries to \nget even *one* map as entertaining as those in the \noriginal gladiator package.\n\nI opt for a smaller number of scenarios (read: 5-10) \nbecause builders will be able to concentrate on \nquality and a consistent, well-written storyline.  \nThere will also be less variability in score if \nthere are fewer scenarios; cheaters won&#39;t have as \nmuch room.  Of course, if people are going to cheat, \nyou can&#39;t stop them.  It&#39;s easy to cheat only a \nlittle bit, or &#39;bend&#39; the rules by harvesting slimes \nor badguy generators so you can make a scenario last \nforever.\n\n&gt;The team I am considering is 2 clerics and 1 fire \nelemental.  I \n&gt;haven&#39;t quite figured out who my 4th team member \nwill be, but it \n&gt;wouldn&#39;t be a thief, a mage, a skeleton, or a \nghost.\n\nIf this tournament has 20 scenarios in it, my team \nwill probably have two clerics, a druid, and yeah, a \nfire elemental - just because they pack so much \npunch for a decent price.  Why the druid?  The trees \nare pretty powerful if you use them as an attack in \nthe early levels, and a great defense mechanism - if \nyou can keep your teammates behind the border!\n\n\n\n"}}
