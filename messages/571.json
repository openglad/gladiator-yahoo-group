The only thing I would want is aceess to an uncompiled \n&gt;version of the new scenario editor.  In fact, if possible I suggest we \n&gt;leave full access to uncompiled version for anyone who wants it.\n\nAs Deathifier pointed out, much of the programming should be ANSI C or C++ ... more compatable, that way (for linux ports, etc)..\n\nBut there should be a chosen compiler for the &#39;official release&#39;, whatever that may be.\n\nI&#39;m not a pro coder... i&#39;m not even really a hobbyist anymore.. but I&#39;ve got some knowledge that may prove useful, and I have access to programmers with far more skill than I if need-be. :)\n\nI e-mailed DPH privately, thinking he was gonna be lead programmer.. Obviously, this is no longer the case. At any rate, here&#39;s basically what I said to him:\n\nI know a little bit of 80x86 asm (which won&#39;t be useful) and Java (which won&#39;t be useful).. I&#39;m pretty familiar with C and C++ and have done minor programs for them in ms-dos and linux.. nothing on this scale, though.\n\nI&#39;ve studied computer programming since I was in 2nd grade (when I started with Atari Basic and Atari Machine Language) so I know a good bit about programming theory and can adapt to new things pretty quickly. I almost made it my major in college, but the science course requirements were a little too much, so I&#39;ve switched to a different major.\n\n... so, anyone ever coded a group project before? (and, should this be opensource or closed source?)\n\n-George &quot;Cookie&quot; Phillips\nAnime News Network\nCo-Editor-In-Chief\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com\n\n\n"}}
