My programming might be kinda rusty\nthough. It would probably be good if we could use java, because it&#39;s\nfairly simple and has free compiler and developement kit. either that or\nthe GNU C compiler, again because it&#39;s free,  though more complicated\nthan java I think.  I have a feeling the format is not overly complex\nand someone that knew what they were doing could probably figgure it\nout,  but that would take quite a bit of work.  it would be interesing\nto try and figgure out but I do have a summer vacation to enjoy and\nseveral other prodjects (mostly linux stuff) that I&#39;m working on ;)\n\nDaniel Paul Hightower wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)Why are we bothering with this discussion?  In the off-chance that\n&gt; somebody at FSGames make give us access to scenario specs.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree it needs to be start from stratch for the most part with a\n&gt; new editor.  It should combine features from both scen.exe and\n&gt; editor.exe .  Resizing should definitely be in the features of the\n&gt; new scenario editor.  I had to resize &#39;The Weakest Link&#39; in much the\n&gt; same way Telvido has had to do with his scenarios.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wait a minute:  There is a feature in editor.exe to allow you to\n&gt; replace all of one tile type to another?\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that brings up another point:  The documentation for the new\n&gt; scenario editor needs to be very complete, listing all features and\n&gt; explaining how to access them.  Copy-and-paste feature for objects\n&gt; should be included as well as undelete.  A nice touch would be\n&gt; allowing us to control the individual stats for NPCs and opponents\n&gt; (Example: setting the intelligence level of a mage at an extremely\n&gt; high level).\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
