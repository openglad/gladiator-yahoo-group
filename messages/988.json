I&#39;d rather not cross that bridge until I have to.\n\n2)no posting screen shots of a scenario WITHOUT the permission of the \ncreator of the scenario.  Screen shots from built-in scenarios are \nautomatically ok, right Tom Ricket?\n\n3)if I start to have problems with people (emphasis: more than 3) \nbreaking the 1st two rules, I will shut down access to moderators only \ncan upload photos.  Unfortunately, this will also effect the files \narea.\n\n\n"}}
