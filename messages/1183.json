Originally, I attached a scenario \nnumber #204 from my personal collection.  That would have made 50.\n\n[If I ever decide to do a follow-up and the game has improved enough \nto handle a follow-up, I&#39;ll start from right where I left off.  There \nare some unresolved plots left to take care of.]\n\nSome of my illegitimate characters have had trouble beating some of \nthose scenarios unless cheating occurred: freezing time, summoning \nfire elementals, or artifically increasing the amount of magical \nenergy available.  I left things off where opponents would have to be \nat experience 20+.  That means I can no longer uses mages as opponents \n(freezing time could wipe out teams).  I am concerned about using \narchmages because of potential system freezes caused by \nchain-lightning; if I use such high experience archmages I can&#39;t give \nenough NPC help without the aforementioned risk.  In one of my \nscenarios, you originally had a lot more NPC help, until I ran into \nheartburst/chain lightning problems with the opponent.\n\nOh yea, elves at those experience levels could stay in a forest and \nkeep attacking without running out of energy except for brief moments. \n That would mean I can&#39;t use elves or large forested maps.\n\nDruids at those experience levels could keep you busy cleaning out \ntheir waves of protection (game issue) for dead characters because you \nspecial attacks don&#39;t work against waves of protection (game issue).  \nThieves could run around invisible, forcing you to resort attacking \nrandom areas or using heartburst/chain lightning attack.  Faerie \nopponets basically nuetralize mages/archmages with one blow [one \nattack can keep an archmage/mage frozen for 30+ minutes].\n\n\n"}}
