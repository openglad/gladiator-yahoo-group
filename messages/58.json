Gladiator doesn&#39;t currently support modem or\nnetwork play; only cramming people together on one computer :(\n\nThe various cheats make your characters stronger (add hitpoints, add mana,\netc.); give them special abilities (start flying, become invisible, etc.)\nand similar things. They&#39;re generally non-permanent; in other words, you\nuse them for a burst of power, and your character reverts to &quot;normal&quot; after\na time period.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
