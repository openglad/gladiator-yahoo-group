It does run (at insanely \nhigh\n&gt; speed, go P600...) and has at least 1 or 2 levels buried in it.\n&gt; The file is ~17MB, and I don&#39;t know if the above link still works - \nI still\n&gt; have it, and DPH is right, the yahoo groups file storage has (just) \nenough\n&gt; space to hold it.\n\nHopefully,file space shouldn&#39;t be an issue.  We&#39;re just now \napproaching using 0.5 megabytes of our file space.  When we start \ngetting close to having only 1 megabyte of storage space available, \nwe&#39;ll deal with it then.\n \n&gt; However there is one minor problem - the software is actually owned \nby the\n&gt; Forgotten Sages, and thus you&#39;ll probably find that the copy we have\n&gt; actually falls under the &#39;warez&#39; category and so it&#39;s likely to be\n&gt; prohibited by Yahoo :)\n&gt; To get around that we simply need someone from FS to tell us we can \nupload\n&gt; it, and maybe put a note somewhere in the groups online presence so \nYahoo\n&gt; doesn&#39;t go deleting it.\n\nPart of the solution is putting a password on the zipped file and use \nthe same one for registered gladiator.  I can solve the rest of \nproblem.  I am a member of the yahoo groups moderators list.  I&#39;ll \nsend a personal email to the yahoo representatives there, explaining \nthat we have permission to post the software there.\n \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ll try to upload it once FS gives us the go-ahead, \nhopefully my  modem connection won&#39;t fall apart part way through it - \ndoes anyone know if yahoo can resume transfers\n\nI doubt it.  \n\nBTW, how long will it take you to upload the file?  It&#39;s been taking  \nabout a minute or so to upload my scenarios to the group area.\n\n\n"}}
