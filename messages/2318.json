Currently they are as a 16-bit double.  What I=\r\n want is\nswitching it out to experience is stored as an integer value stori=\r\nng\nthe experience level number and a double storing the experience points\nb=\r\neyond that.  That temporarily opens the flood gates for getting\nhigher expe=\r\nrience levels without crashing the game.\n\n\n"}}
