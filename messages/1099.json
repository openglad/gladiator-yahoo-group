One thing: I\n&gt; don&#39;t think more than 5 scenarios should be\n&gt; NPC-protecting levels. Frankly, they&#39;re a pain in the\n&gt; ass, and it&#39;s extraordinarily frustrating to play them\n&gt; on Slaughter. It&#39;s not thematic, either... a party of\n&gt; refugees traveling through hostile territory would\n&gt; have to expect to take heavy losses. And if you&#39;re\n&gt; with them, then how would it make sense for the death\n&gt; of your fighters to be okay while the death of a\n&gt; single non-combatant was unacceptable? Screwy. Anyway,\n&gt; we&#39;ll need to agree on a few things: difficulty, of\n&gt; course. Will this be a &quot;from scratch&quot; thing, as in\n&gt; something you start with a brand-new team? How large\n&gt; should the maps be? My preference, of course, is for\n&gt; really large maps, but not everyone will want to spend\n&gt; their time creating non-necessary space. Comments?\n\n1)It is &#39;start from complete stratch&#39;.  I plan on saving the storyline \nso if G:BF gets worked on, we will have an easier time creating 50 \nscenarios for it.\n\n2The basic storyline for all fifty of the scenarios will have to be \nworked out before we start creating any scenarios.  I want to leave \nthings where we can have a follow-up to those 50 scenarios.\n\n3)I am going to really picky about a few things concerning quality.  I \nwant to be able to send a large team (10+ characters) through every \nscenario of the 50 Project without too much difficulty.  I will also \nhave to insist every scenario of the 50 Project can be completed in 1 \nhour or less.\n \n&gt; My version of Gladiator is becoming increasingly\n&gt; unstable. These days I can usually only play a stage\n&gt; or two and then it crashes. I assume this is because\n&gt; of all the .fss and .pix files in my Glad directory...\n&gt; the program has to load all of them. I&#39;m thinking that\n&gt; perhaps, once I&#39;m absolutely sure I like the way the\n&gt; TevFifty are, and everyone else puts out a finished\n&gt; version of their levels, I&#39;ll pull all the files out\n&gt; of the included .001 files and re-pack it all, with\n&gt; the new stuff. Just a thought.\n&gt;     -T.\n\nI have been meaning to finish my set of 50 up.  I have planned the \nrest of the scenarios I am going to create.  I just gotta build them. \n [I can&#39;t wait to release &#39;The Tunneled Labryinth&#39;; that&#39;s going to be \nits own topic for comparison of average completion times of that \nscenario.]\n\nI have busy on TGS staff working on outlines for stories and I can&#39;t \ngive away spoilers either.  If/when one of my stories gets published, \nexpect to see a little Off Topic reference.\n\n\n"}}
