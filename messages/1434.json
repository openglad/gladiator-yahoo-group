It&#39;s so bad that I haven&#39;t taken time to try out the \nscenarios in the unimatrix series.\n\nRight now, I&#39;m 3/5 plus 3/40 completed with one project (with luck I \nshould be finished with that project by the end of this month).  Then, \nI have a small task to do when I complete that project (that&#39;s 1-2 \nweeks max).  Once I complete that task, then I have another project I \nwant to work on (I haven&#39;t started work on estimating how long that \nproject will take).  After that point, I might have time.\n\nI passed my files for my VB level editor for someone to work on since \nI don&#39;t have time right now.\n\n*Starts to wonder what this week&#39;s topic will be*\n\n\n"}}
