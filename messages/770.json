Unfortunately or fortunately, Seth Mitchell is the owner\nof this list.\n\nThe website and archives of our posted messages can be accessed by\nanybody.  The problem is you have to be registered with yahoo in order\nto post messages from the website and participate in polls and we\nwould have that same basic problem anywhere: you have to be\nregistered within the website to post from the website.  Remember:\nthis list started off on onelist.com (before I was here) and onelist\nwas bought or merged with egroups.  Egroups was bought out by yahoo.\nBeing registered with egroups didn&#39;t make someone registered with\nyahoo.  That&#39;s part of the reason I want to go through the membership\nlist.\n\n4 reasons I plan on going through the membership list:\n1)remove bad email addresses.\n2)remove anyone from the list who does not want to be on this list\n3)make sure everybody is registered with yahoo so that he/she can post\nmessages from the website and participate in polls\n4)do a very accurate survey of this list to find out who&#39;s interested\nin playing in a tournament.\n\nPart of the reason I haven&#39;t started is I was looking for some topic\nthat would keep this board active so I would have the time to go\nthrough membership list without having to keep starting new topics.\n\nIf/when we get around to working on tournament scenarios, I will\ncreate a separate yahoo group just to work on that short-term project.\n  Afterwards, I might leave that group around just to evaluate the\ntournament successes and failures and to make plans for another\ntournament.  I would like to have an anuual gladiator tournament.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
