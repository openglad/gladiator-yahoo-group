Literally, based on\ncomments about my set of 50, I&#39;m unavailable for this job.\n\nThis job means laying out the plot to give the scenarios purpose -\nwhat goes on between scenarios.\n\n3rd)Somebody needs to be in charge of overall scenario design - this\nisn&#39;t creativity, but making sure things like there is room to walk\naround and fight battles in tight areas and all keys can be reached\nunless that&#39;s not the point.  I&#39;m nominating myself for this job.\n\n4th)Somebody needs to be in charge of the scenario variety and\ncreativity - This is about making sure that too many scenarios don&#39;t\nlook almost alike and trying to keep everybody from reusing the same\nplans for creating scenarios.  I don&#39;t want to fill this job since I&#39;m\nalready doing another.\n\n5th)We need at least 3 people to actually create the scenarios.  I\nplan on doing so.  We need at least two others.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
