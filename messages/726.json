The whole point of halfings is \ncreating stronger characters.  If you really want to get technical, \nbanning half clerics is more effective.  It is way too easy for \nclerics to accumulate experience (using &#39;heal&#39;) and and any other \ncharacter equipped with that ability, would have no trouble gaining \nlots of experience really quick.\n\n&gt; don&#39;t you think 20&#39;s too steep? people will never use there \ncharecters\n\nWhat would you propose?  experience level 15?  The idea is you&#39;ve \nreached a point where you&#39;ve maxed out on using both character&#39;s \nabilities individually and you want to progress.  One character [I \nforgot which one] requires you to reach experience level 12 before you \nget access to all  abilites.  I want some point a few steps further \nthan that before allowing the creation of halfings.  By requiring a \nhigher experience level for halfings, it should make some people think \ntwice before creating a halfing.\n\n\n"}}
