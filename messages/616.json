May I suggest each one of you all \npotentially working on the new scenario editor, as proof of your \nknowledge, create a simple program to extract from the grid file, a \nlist of objects in a grid and save the information to a text file and \ncreate a program to take said text file and convert it to a grid file? \n I know that sounds simple enough, but is a nice way of proving your \nknowledge.  BTW, if anyone wants to speculate about why I want the \naforementioned programs, one reason:  those two programs plus a text \neditor equals one primitve scenario editor to work with while awaiting \na completely new one.\n\n\n"}}
