I deliberately let \nan elf get too much experience.  It only took me 3 scenarios to give \nthe elf too much experience [for some unknown reason it&#39;s easier for \nan elf to crash the game with too much experience points than an \narcher.  The damn archer got some powerfull that I had to launch \nexploding bolt attacks from 1/4 of a mile away to avoid the \naftershocks.  (I am convinced that, in real life, one of those \nexploding bolts would be powerfull enough to level NYC.)  Just j/k, \nbut it was pretty far away.].\n\nOn the other hand, I discovered a new way to defeat opponents: fill \nthe scenario with mega rocks.  Even a mage or an archmage can&#39;t dodge \nthe rocks for very long.\n\n\n"}}
