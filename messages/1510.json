Tom suggested it\na long time ago and the name stuck. We&#39;ve been using it to distinguish\nbetween Gladiator the original and the port, and we&#39;ve gotten used to it.\n- Openscen: port of the scenario editor\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- the binary tarball contains Linux binaries only. We havn&#39;t gotten it to\ncompile under anything but Linux (only tried Linux and Windows), and its\nnot on our todo list yet, but if you manage to get the source compiling\nunder any other platform, let us know how you did it and we&#39;ll include it\nin future releases.\n\nLacking features:\n\n- Scrolling by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen in openscen\n(this was generating immense amounts of bugs so we replaced it with other\nways to scroll)\n- fade in/out (minor feature, but worth mentioning. we&#39;ll implement it\nsoon)\n\nAdded features:\n\n- Multiple joystick support: you can now have every player playing on a\njoystick\n- Minimap-scrolling: you can now more around in openscen by clicking on\nthe minimap\n- Key scrolling: you can now scroll in openscen using the keypad\n\nCredits:\n\n- FSGames deserves 99.9% of the credit for writing the original game\nand open sourcing it. Snowstorm is forever thankful to them.\n- Zardus and Sean did all of the porting\n- dph_of_rules deserves a special thanks for creating his scenario pack,\nwhich we used to stress test the game and catch some bugs and\nslowdowns (especially his scenario 150).\n\nKnown Bugs:\n\n- Phantom mode (cleric&#39;s mystic mace, mage&#39;s energy wave, anything that\nwarps the ground underneath) is still slow if there&#39;s too many of those\ntypes of objects on the screen. It&#39;s ok normally, but if you&#39;re in dph&#39;s\nscenario 150, it gets slow on my Athlon 750\n\nWhere to get it:\n\nhttp://snowstorm.sourceforge.net - Snowstorm&#39;s site. You can download it\nfrom there\nhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm - you can download it from the\nsourceforge project page as well\n\n\nHave fun!\n\n- Zardus\n\nPS. Props to anyone who can tell me what level the four-player screenshot\non snowstorm.sourceforge.net is from.\n\n\n\n"}}
