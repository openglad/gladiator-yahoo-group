But maybe an ability to &quot;fortify&quot;\ns=\r\nome of your guys, so they stay in one spot, and maybe throw up some\nmore pr=\r\notection would help; at least they wouldn&#39;t wander off and get\nkilled.\n\nI&#39;d=\r\n agree to that, but there are times when large teams really get in\nthe way =\r\nand there are times early on when a small team just can&#39;t cut\nit.  For exam=\r\nple, going through Tev&#39;s &quot;stairs&quot; or his maze, a team of\nmore that 4 charac=\r\nters really won&#39;t cut it that well.  On the other\nhand, there are times whe=\r\nn you are approached by such a large army\nthat you really need more troops =\r\nunless your own are significantly\nsuperior.\n\n\n"}}
