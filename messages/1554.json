It&#39;d also\nbenefit from people just finding out about Gladiator and joining it (I do\nhave a link to this group from the front page, but not many people go to\nthe front page). An tracker item can also be added where people would be\nable to upload maps and stuff, so the files section won&#39;t be lost.\n\n&gt; Also on the short term, reluctantly I am considering shutting down\n&gt; public access to message archives to keep spammers from harvesting\n&gt; email addresses from our messages.\n\nThat&#39;s one thing the sourceforge mailing lists can&#39;t do.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
