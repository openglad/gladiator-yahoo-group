I am actually going to work on creating a series of episodes\nand \n let my extreme level be the last one.  I am going to redo the\nextreme \n level with a larger map area and a slightly different scenary \narrangement.\n\nI am glad to know it is possible to beat my extreme level with a \nlegitimate team.  Like I said before, I will be working on creating \nscenarios to boost a team up to the point where a legitimate team \ncomposed of at least 2 members can beat it.  Right now, I am sending \nmy slightly legitimate team through the tevfifty and see if they end \nup \nstrong enough to beat my extreme level.\n\nI am saving a team [composed of one elf, 2 mages, and 2 clerics] (not \nsending through any scenarios) for when I complete all the scenarios\nI \nplan on creating.\n\n\n"}}
