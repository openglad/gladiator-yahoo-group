I know of at least 3 proposed new promoted \n character classes for this category (high priest, asassin, practical \n mage). - Also, I&#39;ll be releasing my scenario trivia contest \nquestions.  I will not mind if someone wants to add more questions to \nthe scenario trivia contest.\n \n2)Game Issues of Health, Potions of Magic, and Mana - yep, we will \nbe talking about health and mana of characters for a week. Somehow, it \n will be tied to Hybrid/dual class discussion.\n \n3)3 weeks on hybrid/dual class - we&#39;ll just have to wait and see why \nI want to handle this in 3 parts.\n \n4)Game Issues of Potion of Speed, Speed, and Teleporters\n \n5)Game Issues of Generators\n\n6)Game Issues of Experience Points & Experience Levels\n \n7)Game Issues of Basic Intelligence for characters - Scenario trivia \ncontest answers need to be emailed to me by this week.\n\n8)Scenario Trivia Contest - I&#39;ll hit answers to the objective \nquestions first  during the first week, then tackle 2-3 objective \nquestions at a time.  That&#39;s going to take 4 weeks minimum to go \nthrough those.\n\n9)Critique of dph&#39;s legimate scenarios.  Don&#39;t worry I will not \n&quot;punish&quot; anyone for bad reviews.  This will take a few weeks and I&#39;ll \nalso be listing what the heck was going through my mind when I \ndesigned each of my scenarios.  Hopefully I&#39;ll be finished cleaning up \nmy scenarios by then.\n\n * * * *\n\nSince I know no person cares about this, I&#39;ll say it anyways, the next \nversion of my scenarios will be a few days away.  It&#39;s going to take \nlots of time to do cleanup.  Maybe, I&#39;ll find a way to be happy with \none of my scenarios.\n\n\n"}}
