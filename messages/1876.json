I&#39;m all for testing and fixing it, but 21934 is one heck of \na number for a stat. Cheating or not, the mouse and finger work would \ntake a while.\n\nThe limit on strength for a soldier was way higher than that so I \nfear you may have to search the code to determine the spots where \nstats are free.  I know a fast way to get that high with any \nindividual stat, especially with the information available to you: \ncreate a saved game file with the stats you wish to test against.  \nSurely, it wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal to write a short program \njust to create a saved game file.  The limit on strength for a soldier \nwas way higher than that.  \n\nI have no ideas on limits for constitution or dexteriority.  (I never \ncould find the limit on armor because I literally ran out of money.)\n\nOf course, you also understand why I propose redoing the picker for \nstats: save time buying stats.\n\n\n"}}
