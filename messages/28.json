The password might contain the type and numbers of characters you had on the last level  you played, your remaining gold, and most importantly, your level reached.\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion, I know the people at FS Games are busy with life now, but I figured the list needed to be spewed on.\r\n\r\n-Chris\n\n\n\n"}}
