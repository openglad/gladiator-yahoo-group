Also, at \nhigh experience levels, it&#39;s impossible for skeleton to use any mana \nfor either tunnel or it&#39;s basic attack.\n\nAlso, there should be some limits on a ghost&#39;s ability to scare \ncharacters.  There should be a point where a level 20 ghost&#39;s &quot;scare&quot; \nattack has a minimal effect on a level 50+ character.  Also, ghosts \nshould have a stronger immunity to their own attack.\n\nWhen you have the choice of raising a skeleton or raising a ghost, \nwhich one do you raise?\n\nI only raise a ghost when I need room to maneuver around enemies; \notherwise, I raise a skeleton when I need extra troops.\n\nWhen one of my teams reach a certain point, I view experience level \n1-5 enemy characters as potential teammates.\n\n\n"}}
