So when I get hooked up at home and find some time I&#39;ll have to try some of the new levels out(they sound interesting).  Been a while since I played gladiator though and I never really got to the point where I &quot;kicked ass&quot; so It should be a good test.\n\n\n&gt;I think we can safely say that my levels DON&#39;T suck. I haven&#39;t been getting \n&gt;much feedback, and the site has been getting almost no traffic, but everyone \n&gt;who&#39;s tried them (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html) seems to like \n&gt;them... Of course, for a permanent posting I would like to revise them one \n&gt;more time. Would someone other than DPH care to comment on them? At all? \n&gt;Just to say that you downloaded them? ...anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt;         -Tevildo, the unappreciated Prince of Cats.\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at \n&gt;http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n"}}
