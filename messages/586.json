All of the energy gets converted into one \nblow of faerie dust.  Another proposed attack would be &quot;Carry&#39;.  This \nwould allow faeries to carry their own teammates.  Hmm.  What would be \na third attack?\n\n--- In gladiator@y..., &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@y...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Golems - Only new attack I could think I was &#39;Tornado&#39;.  A golem \nspins \n&gt; its body around, allowing it to temporarily go through trees and \nover \n&gt; water.  The attack would hurt opponents who get hit by the golem and \n&gt; this new attack would effectively make attacks against Golems count \nas \n&gt; 1/2-1/4 their value.  Wait minute, why not give Golems a pinball \nmode \n&gt; attack.  All it would do is roll around and hit objecdts,  This \nattack \n&gt; would give Golems incredible speed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Giant Skeletons - Definitely &#39;Split&#39; into 5-6 normal sized \nskeletons. \n&gt;  No inspiration for an original attack.  Maybe if I had more sleep \n&gt; [it&#39;s not my fault, just the moron I live with], I might be able to \n&gt; think of something.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe in limiting each character to 4 attacks with possible \n&gt; alternates for each attack.  This will keep any character from \n&gt; becoming too powerfull.\n\n\n"}}
