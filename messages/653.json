Maybe in a similiar game with a science fiction\ntheme.\n&gt;  A robot would just look out of place among elementals and archers and\nother\n&gt; fantasy creatures.\n\nI agree, a robot doesn&#39;t really belong in gladiator, although the &quot;Throw\nopponent&quot; skill sounds neat, and perhaps the knock-back ability from a\nclose-combat hit can be given to another class?\n\n&gt; I also thought of a promotion.  A druid could become a\n&gt; Sorceror sometime that could summon special forest creatures like wolfs\nand\n&gt; bears and whatever.\nSounds interesting (also sounds like the druid in the Diablo 2 expansion :),\nalthough sorcerors are associated more with mages so perhaps a different\nname is needed.\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
