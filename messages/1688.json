There is no REAL \npurpose for towers, but they could be interesting at one point if \ntriggers were added.\n\nGolems are interesting creatures for the game, the problem being \ntheir size. Almost any level has a spot where a golem could not get \nto. Truely I think golems should be summoned as the Master Druid \nspell (level 15 or something). They are too big for regular levels.\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower \n&lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt;&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yea, this week, we are talking about Golems and Towers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s hear the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n\n"}}
