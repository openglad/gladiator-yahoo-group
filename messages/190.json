As soon as I can get on a comp with a\n&gt; better browser (i.e. not IE) I&#39;ll fix that all up properly.\n&gt;\n&gt; Strategy? Well, I must confess that my most effective team consists of one\n&gt; archmage. Alone. His chain lightning is THE most impressive effect in the\n&gt; game. I&#39;ve been able to kill everyone in a level with one blast. Of\ncourse,\n&gt; there are serious drawbacks to using one character with a bad\nhand-to-hand.\n&gt; Against an enemy with a comparable level, it takes forever to do serious\n&gt; damage, so it&#39;s usually best to &#39;port away and create a flock of\nelementals\n&gt; to do your dirty work. You can also summon the image of a druid and use it\n&gt; to create real faerie to freeze the opponent. I&#39;ve been experimenting with\na\n&gt; team of two clerics, a mage, and an archmage, but it seems to take too\nlong\n&gt; to advance them to massive-kill levels. It&#39;s just too hard to use teams,\n&gt; unless you go in with overwhelming force or struggle to keep everyone\n&gt; together with yells. If there were going to be further versions of the\ngame,\n&gt; I would suggest that team play be improved...\n&gt;\n&gt; DPH, what do you mean an RP? A Gladiator fan-fic? That would be cool, I\n&gt; guess... I incorporated a running storyline into my scenarios, but that&#39;s\n&gt; not really the same. (It turned out much better than Tryxian\nChronicles...)\n&gt; Everyone seems to love Torvald and Neldwyn; why don&#39;t we see who can write\n&gt; the best Torvald story? Or maybe a Torvald theme song?\n&gt;                  -Tevildo.\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Was the salesman clueless?
