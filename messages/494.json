Where should I try out next at high\n&gt; experience levels?  Cleric, Druid, Orc, or Barbarian?  Nope, I will\n&gt; definitely not try out faeries, skeletons, ghosts, or fire elementals\n&gt; [well, I sorta have tried out fire elementals, only summoned].\n&gt; \n&gt; I will definitely get &#39;The Weakest Link&#39; finished soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
