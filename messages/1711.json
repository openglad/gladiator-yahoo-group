As a summoned fire elemental loses health, it drains health \nfrom the archmage who summoned it.\n\nThings could be set up so that when a summoned fire elemental uses \nsuicide attack, it takes 25%-50% (depending on available health of the \narchmage: if the archmage has more health less percent is used, but if \nthe archmage is at 50% health or lower, at least 40% of the archmage&#39;s \nhealth is taken for each suicide attack) of the archmage&#39;s health \nalong with it.\n\nThat way, by the time the 2nd fire elemental is &quot;sacrificed&quot;, your \narchmage is in deep trouble if it gets hit.  If the archmage isn&#39;t in \ntrouble at that point, then why are you &quot;sacrificing&quot; summoned fire \nelementals?\n\n\n"}}
