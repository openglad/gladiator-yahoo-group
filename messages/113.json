I wish I was on vacation to but alas that is not the case. I haven&#39;t\n&gt;really talked to any of you before so I don&#39;t post much.   (Tom) I love\n&gt;gladiator, alot. A friend recently got me started on gauntlet for the\n&gt;playstation after I showed them Gladiator and I like it alot too. But Glad is\n&gt;much better... Everyone is always talking about posting or making maps. How\n&gt;do you get them? Thanks.. Have a great summer! (what&#39;s left of it anyway)\n&gt;  lol\n\nYes, gauntlet was one of our favorite games, way back .. er, too many years \nago to count :) It had a strong part in forming what we wanted to do for \nGladiator.\n\nFor the maps and levels .. so far, a nice fellow named Chris has been \nworking on taking what we have, and turning it into a master list .. let&#39;s \nsee .. he should be on the list; also, his e-mail address is: \nshayd@...  in case you want to ask him directly :)\n\nAnd yes -- I really should have an updated page listing user levels .. I&#39;ll \ntry to get around to it eventually, honest! ;-&gt;\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
