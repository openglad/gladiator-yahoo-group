BTW, Tevildo could you send to me \nyour generic PIX file?\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;-Tevildo.&quot; &lt;Tevildo@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Okay, if you&#39;re ready to take the extra step and add Editor.exe\ninto \nyour \n&gt; level-making process, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned...\n&gt; \n&gt; tiles 0-133 can be used; other numbers are available in Editor but \nif you \n&gt; use these it will crash Scen.exe or Glad.exe\n&gt; \n&gt; tile 8 is the one I mentioned previously, the &quot;permeable wall&quot;\nwhich \nruns \n&gt; vertical rather than horizontal (Use &#39;em, DPH!)\n&gt; \n&gt; tiles 53 and 54 were apparently made funny, so I altered them into \nusable \n&gt; column tiles--the Tevildo-altered versions are packed into\nTevFifty, \nif you \n&gt; want to use them\n&gt; \n&gt; Editor.exe can also be used to change the dimensions of a map,\nwhich \nI found \n&gt; VERY useful, as some of my levels are very long one way and very \nthin the \n&gt; other way. You can also use it to change all tiles of a particular \ntype into \n&gt; another type instantly. I suggest that everyone make a palette .PIX \nfile \n&gt; with samples of all 134 usable tiles, which you can pull up in \nScen.exe for \n&gt; easy access to any map pieces you could ever need. I&#39;d simply send \nyou mine, \n&gt; but the Mailing List rules say no attachments. Anyway, I hope \neveryone can \n&gt; use Editor successfully, as it&#39;s a powerful tool. I may use it to \nalter the \n&gt; character images one of these days, but I have other projects to \nwork on \n&gt; first.
