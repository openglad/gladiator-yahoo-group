I have to pick off the blobs with chain \nlightning or \n&gt; exploding bolts while they&#39;re still enclosed.\n\nHey, you just told everybody how to beat that problems:  keep the \ndoors closed.  Why do think I put so many doors around those slime?  \nIn general, I like complete control.  However, the brag has certain \nproblems with keeping enemies from fighting each other.  I have added \nmore doors in attempt to keep the monsters from penetrating, but they \ninsist on breaking through.\n\n\n Now, orc commanders... \nthey \n&gt; have no real purpose, and could use some further coding. I mean, why \ndo they \n&gt; have no abilities? That&#39;s crazy. How about... if an orc commander is \nwithin \n&gt; ten squares of an orc, that orc gets his stats increased by 25%. \n\nGood point about orc captains.\n\n\nAlso, if towers had a close-range special, &quot;Boiling Oil&quot; \nor \n&gt; something, I think it would make for some fun times. Hehe... boiling \noil.\n\nThat would make things more interesting.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;I had my entire team (1 mega powered archmage) mind controlled once\n&gt; &gt;and it lasted after the offending archmage was dead.  My team has \n&gt;been \n&gt; &gt;effected by enemy chain lightning in one of the original \n&gt;scenarios.  I \n&gt; &gt;have seen enemy mages freeze time REPEATEDLY in a &gt;certain one of \nthe \n&gt; &gt;tevfifty and one of my own scenarios has been &gt;accused of fostering \nmages \n&gt; &gt;that repeatedly freeze time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it a gameplay problem? If there&#39;s something wrong with one of my \nlevels, \n&gt; I&#39;ll fix it. I have to wonder if there are certain conditions under \nwhich \n&gt; the enemies use more of their abilities than they normally do. I&#39;ve \nmade \n&gt; levels where the enemy mages use warp space a lot, and some where \nthey just \n&gt; don&#39;t. I can&#39;t figure out what triggers them to do this.\n\nYou are probably right,  Under certain conditions, certain \ncharacters use certain attacks more often.  Maybe the folks at FSGames \ncan explain character behavior better.\n\nSlime seem to love to multiply when there is plently of space, but \ngiven the same amount of space in a different situation, the slime \nwill not multiply (Slime Lords - the slime that are isolated sometimes \nsplit, sometimes not).  I would love to know what it would take to \nguarantee slime multiply evertime, druids summon faeries, etc.\n\nThe biggest defeciency (IMHO) with coding is what to the character \ndoes when it has max magic power.  If the scenario is completely \ndefeated, slime should not multiply, mages should not freeze time, \ndruids should not be growing trees, summoning faeries, etc.  On the \nother hand, if the scenario is not defeated the following should \noccur:\n  slime should be growing/splitting [that would make slime truely     \nscary] when they reach max magic power.  \n  Archmages should be summoning images/fire elementals instead of \nleaving teleporter markers.\n  Clerics should be actively looking to raise undead and heal team \nmates.  \n  Druids should be summoning faeries.\n  you get the picture.\n\nIMHO, the most powerfull attacks are those in which you increase the \nnumber of your teammates.  Summoning images/fire elementals, raising \nundead, and summoning faeries are among the most powerfull attacks.\n \n&gt; I never really liked ghosts. In all honesty, I prefer levels with \nnormal \n&gt; humans to play against, like Nilwyn Town.\n\nMy only problem with ghosts is that it is difficult to control where \nthey are.  For that reason, I will not use ghosts in any scenarios \nwhere there are multiple teams.  However, I am using ghosts a lot in \nmy scenarios on the ocean.\n\n\n"}}
