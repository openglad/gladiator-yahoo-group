Hang on, are there such things? Is there a way you can make it so if a certain NPC dies, the level ends in failure for your team? Or is an unnoficial rule that if that character dies, you have to quit?\nOn slaughter, Troy and Commander really went down to Dirk, Kyle and James. Thankfully they somehow regenerated after each level :)\n\nWell I took both of your suggestions.\nFirst of all, I downloaded the Tevfifty (right?) levels. Well they sure seem hard enough, however I&#39;m kind of disappointed with the lack of detail you put into the maps. And why do you choose hordes of weak lvl guys instead of some tough guys? (Don&#39;t take it personally I&#39;m just asking)\nSecond, I tried to make some of my own levels. I think I did a good job on the map detail, and the plot could really go somewhere, however so far it is a set story, so you have to play the levels in order.\nBut I need to know: which numbers are good to use. Right now Im using lvl 50, 51 and 52.\nAnd how tough should i make it? Right now you&#39;re fighting baddies on lvl 4 - 7. If you think it should be harder, speak up. I tested this map with my lvl 14 archer on battle and he had a tough time.\n\n-Trahern\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nGet free personalized email at http://www.iname.com\n\n"}}
