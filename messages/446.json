That is the same speed setting I used for my 100 mhz \ncomputer.  Any comments about that from the gladiator programmers?\n\nI am thinking about redoing my mega-gold scenario into a beginning \nscenario and adding a few others as a prequel to my normal scenarios.\n\nThe mega-gold scenario contains all $$$$ you should need to buy/equip \nyour team.  All I would need do is add few scenarios to help build up \nthe experience to the point of handling &#39;The Brag&#39;.  Any thoughts \nabout how many scenarios I would need to go from mega-gold to &#39;The \nBrag&#39;?\n\nYep, I do plan on start creating new scenarios pretty soon as in \nmonths.\n\n\n"}}
