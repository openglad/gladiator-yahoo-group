That solves\nproblem #3.\n\nProblem #2 is tric=\r\nky.  I think everybody can agree a computer\ncharacter of experience level 2=\r\n is generally better than the exact\nsame character hired by a player and gi=\r\nven stats.  Figuring out an\nequitable comparison is going to be tricky.\n\nAd=\r\nmittedly, I haven&#39;t played the game in a while because, frankly,\nthere is n=\r\no challenge really left.  The only thing that would make the\ngame challengi=\r\nng to me is improvements in the game itself, no\nnecessarily new levels.\n\nOn=\r\ne of the biggest improvements that would make the game more\nchallenging to =\r\nme is letting me buy a team of 12, but only put 1-6 on\nthe field at a time.=\r\n  The other one is better ai for the characters. \nIn practical terms, you c=\r\nan only keep active control of 6 characters.\n The rest of the characters wo=\r\nuld have to be on their own.  Hey, that\nbrings me another id.  Why not have=\r\n the option of &quot;hands free&quot; mode? \nSimply put, have a way where you don&#39;t h=\r\nave to control anybody on your\nteam, but you could watch.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
