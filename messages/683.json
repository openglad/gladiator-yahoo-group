Chain-lightning shouldn&#39;t pass \nthrough a character unless the character dies because of \nchain-lightning.  I wonder how much time could be saved if you could \nturn off the chain-lightning graphic traveling from one character to \nanother.  Another possibility is limit chain-lightning in such a way \nthat one chain-lightning go after a single character at a time.  If 5 \nchain-lightnings are going after a single character, combine them.\n\nI just tried running chain lightning at speed setting 2, and well, it \ndoesn&#39;t matter.  Handling 60 slime with chain-lightning seem to \nseriously slow it down.\n\nI think it might be faster to go through the entire area effected \n(spelling?)looking for characters as opposed to looking at every \ncharacter and checking coordinates.  Of course that might be \nimpossible if the coding wasn&#39;t written for that.\n\n\n"}}
