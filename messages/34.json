I am currently working on a set of levels (about 12-15), and when I finish them I will create the website.  Again, if anyone has any levels, feel free to email them to me, and I will make sure they go up on the website for others to check out.\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed there was a graphics editor included w/ the game.  Anyone ever tried creating new monsters?  Is it possible, or can you only modify existing creatures?\n\n\n\n"}}
