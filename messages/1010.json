But in some spare time I&#39;ve written up a bit more for my\ngladiator_story.rtf.\n&gt;\n&gt; Somehow, my email address got disconnected by yahoo! groups for some\nreason, so I&#39;ve been missing out on the email for some time now.\n&gt; Once again, come check it out at www.angelfire.com/rpg/zjackrum . Anyone\nwho liked chapter one I hope will continue to enjoy the story I&#39;m beginning\nto unravel.\n&gt; Apologies to Tevildo. I actually was taking care to spell your name\nproperly, but somehow that extra L got in there anyway. It&#39;s fixed now, man!\n&gt; Deathifier: Don&#39;t suppose you got a better name in mind? It doesn&#39;t work\ntoo well as a cleric&#39;s name...\n&gt; Anyone else: Need a name for the new character introduced.... If you&#39;re on\nthe list and you want to be famous, gimme and email and I&#39;ll set you up.\n&gt;\n&gt; As always, post replies either here or to my email address, where they\nwill be keyword-searched for words like &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; and\nif I don&#39;t find them i&#39;ll email-bomb them back to you :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Some feedback would be nice as to where to go for chapter 3....\n&gt;\n&gt; One last thing: I&#39;ve re-registered at yahoo groups under the nickname\nZjackrum, which is my new alias. In the next edition of gladiator_story.rtf,\nthe Trahern character will be switched to Zjackrum, which I prefer.\n&gt; -Trahern/Zjackrum\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; Talk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free!\n&gt; http://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
