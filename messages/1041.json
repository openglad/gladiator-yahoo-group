It is common sense that you wouldn&#39;t want to kill the \nguards, but by saying that, that means that you&#39;re a native to Jakarta-town.\nI can&#39;t say this is really a question, because basically it&#39;s going to \ndepend upon how the storyline advances, but if you are an assassin in \nJakarta town, that leaves you three choices:\n1. You work for the Saervii. Now since the Saervii have been information \ngathering until now, you&#39;ve been lying dormant awaiting your first mission.\n2. You work for Jakarta. You&#39;re anti-rebellion working under Shifter (the \nman in white at the start of chapter 3) This makes you a bad guy that we&#39;ll \nprobably have to kill, since you&#39;re pretty much unbribable.\n3. You&#39;re independant. [I KNOW YOU&#39;RE GOING TO WANT THIS ONE, COME ON, ADMIT \nIT! :D] Whether you&#39;ve been here for a few weeks, or most of your life, you \ndont owe allegiance to anyone, and you&#39;ve done odd jobs for the Saervii \nand/or Jakarta. If there was some way of influence (family member, wife, \nchildren get killed or somethin) then maybe we could get you over to the \nSaervii. Or you could be like Shadow from ff3 and work for money.\n\n-Zjack\n--\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com/intl.asp\n\n\n"}}
