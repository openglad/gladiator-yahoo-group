The archmage-cleric combination would be the most threatening\nto most people, whereas a soldier-archer combination wouldn&#39;t be as\nthreatening.  However I am more scared of a slime-anything else\ncombination for one reason: you could quickly raise up an army of high\nmobility characters.\n\n2nd, I believe in restricting the making of halfings until both\npotential partners have reached experience level 20 or higher.  That&#39;s\nnot going to be an easy task of getting two characters beyond\nexperience level 20 (only way to get there far would be too go through\n  all the built-in scenarios, all the tevfifty, and then go through my\nscenarios to reach that point.)\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
