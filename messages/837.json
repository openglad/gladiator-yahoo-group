I believe it has something to do with it&#39;s state and who planted\nit, but I&#39;m not sure (it was in a previous message when someone asked about\nsome odd error that popped up in game).\n\nI can probably use one of the extended ASCII characters, except they usually\nshow up as a little square box in a text editor (like notepad, wordpad) and\nyou don&#39;t want to remove them cause you may not be able to put it back :)\nIt also makes hand-building a new line harder, though you could just copy\nand paste it if you wanted.\nI&#39;ll try doing that tonight, gotta get it and a couple of other things\nfinished soon before the uni workload picks up and it stops *everything*\nagain :(\n\n- Deathifier\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 23, 2001 5:42 AM\nSubject: [gladiator] Re: Disallowed characters in Gladiator.\n\n\n&gt; --- In gladiator@y..., &quot;Deathifier&quot; &lt;storey@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Hi,\n&gt; &gt; Does anyone know if specific characters are not allowed in\n&gt; Gladiator?\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, sadly, you can&#39;t lay/lie bombs out on the scenario waiting to\n&gt; explode.
