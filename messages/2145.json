This would be ultimate hardest difficulty\nlevel ever possible.\n\nWhat would happen?  All characters on the opponent&#39;s side would be\nreborn and come back with a higher experience level.  Something like\nEvery character who is below experience level 20 comes back with a 20%\nhigher experience level (minimum jump forward is, obviously, 1) and\nthose with experience level 20 or higher come back with a 10% higher\nexperience level.  I&#39;m not sure what the terms for leaving that kind\nof scenario: if you can manage to get to the exit when all your\nopponents are destroyed or after you beat each character a set number\nof times.\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\n"}}
