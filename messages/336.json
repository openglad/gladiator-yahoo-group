But no, I have to do school stuff,\nand then I end up playing Myth 2 a lot in my spare time.  Wish I had a copy of warcraft2\nbnet; all I&#39;ve got is the old version, and I can&#39;t run that on my new computer cause the\nmous scroll is just too fast.  I used to make maps for that a lot.  had some pretty cool\nones but over the years most have been lost, except the 3 or so of the best ones I posted\non my website way back. . (www.perfidious.net).\nToo bad gladiator doesn&#39;t allow co-op games over the internet.  I bet it wouldn&#39;t be\n*that* hard to change one player input to come from the network, but then it would\nrequire a lot of modification to the program on the side that wasn&#39;t hosting. .  dang.\nI&#39;m thinkin the guys at FSgames probably have even less time than me.  Oh well, can keep\ndreamin anyway.\n\nbtw, what happened with your plans about the character fiction stories?\n\n-Bj�rn\n\nTom Tildrum wrote:\n\n&gt; For several years I&#39;ve had a disk laying around with a bunch of .PUD files\n&gt; on it, but I didn&#39;t know exactly what those were so I left them alone. I\n&gt; recently obtained a copy of the Warcraft II Battlechest (full basic version\n&gt; w/online matchup and expansion levels) and found that .PUDs are\n&gt; player-designed Warcraft levels, and those ones on the disk were all based\n&gt; on The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. Naturally, I\n&gt; tried them out, and some of them kicked ass and some of them sucked. They\n&gt; got me thinking: the three games I&#39;m involved in now are Warcraft,\n&gt; Gladiator, and The Two Towers (a Tolkien-based Multi-User Dimension,\n&gt; http://angband.com/towers), and crossovers between the three would truly\n&gt; rock. Why not have Warcraft levels based on the stock Gladiator scenarios,\n&gt; or vice versa, or Tolkien-based scenarios with corresponding levels? I threw\n&gt; some Greek mythology into the TevFifty, but I&#39;m thinking here of complete\n&gt; immersion in the story. Gladiator has several advantages in this department:\n&gt; you can include the story blurb, which can be very cool; you can name\n&gt; characters; you can see who the enemy is and go kill him, rather than having\n&gt; to sit there whacking farms and such. With Warcraft, you have better\n&gt; graphics and the ability to wage war at sea and in the sky, but you can only\n&gt; use the preprogrammed character names, and if you want a storyline you have\n&gt; to put it in a separate text file. The magic and the maps are about equal.\n&gt; Anyone have any ideas in this vein? Over the semester break I should have\n&gt; enough time to actually execute some of this stuff in the Tevildo style, and\n&gt; also do that fanfic stuff I was talking about earlier with attached\n&gt; scenarios. I hope there are other people out there doing their own thing,\n&gt; and it&#39;s not just DPH and I creating. Ricky Derr, got any levels for us?\n&gt; Shayd? Anyone? Oh, man... how cool would it be to just insert the code for\n&gt; dragons and death knights into Gladiator... (salivating) That&#39;s all for now.\n&gt; Good luck and regards,\n&gt;    -Tevildo.\n&gt;    http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, did anyone get any use out of the altered rock graphics file I posted to\n&gt; the Egroups site? That was just an experiment... I could alter basically any\n&gt; weapon or character .PIX.
