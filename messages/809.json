I don&#39;t think anyone will create a scenario with \nhalf as many objects as that scenario has.  Glad to know that scenario \nhas a purpose [testing converters to handle large amounts of data) \nbesides boosting up a team with lots of money.\n\nBTW, why play around with that scenario?  Is it because it has so many \nvirtually identical objects?\n\n\n"}}
