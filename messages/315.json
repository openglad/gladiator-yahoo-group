Between time \nbeing frozen repeatedly and those darn generators, I had to use the \narchmage (not the mage) to save the .. wrong thought . . to defeat the \nscenario at Skirmish.  So now I am at scenario 399.  When I finish, I \nwill start to work on testing my scenarios and creating new ones.  I \nwill be testing them at battle level because of the nature of my team \n(1 archmage, 1 mage, and 2 clerics can handle things easier than most \nteams).\n\nHow is progress for other people working on new scenarios?\n\n\n"}}
