On the other hand, \ncharge is a nice way to retreat in a hurry.\n\nmages - if you get to the point where you can freeze time, the game \nbecames a breeze.  Or if you convert your mage to an archmage, you \nshould have no worries once your archmage can summon images/fire \nelementals.\n\nA cloaked thief is an easy enemy to defeat?  I do not think so.\n\nskeletons are difficult to beat because of their speed and tunneling \nability.\n\nA really powerfull ghost can scare away a cleric before the cleric can \nturn it undead.\n\nFaeries are really usefull against mages and archmages.\n\nLevel 30 potion of speed makes you go faster than level 10 potion of \nspeed.  Going too fast can be a severe disadvantage at times.  I might \nmake a scenario just to illustrate that point.\n\n\n"}}
