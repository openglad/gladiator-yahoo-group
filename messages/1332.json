The rules about who can go \nwith whom still apply, but there are some differences:\n\nInstead of the two characters becoming one new character, there is an \nexchange of abilities and the two characters SHARE their health \nliterally.  The armor and experience level of each one goes together \nto produce an initial health level that is the same for both.  Any \ntime that either one loses (or gains) health points, the other one \nloses (or gains) the exact same amount of health points.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
