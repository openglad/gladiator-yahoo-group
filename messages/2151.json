You&#39;re always struggling through the 1st 10-15 scenarios\nto avoid losses and then finally your team can start to hold its own .\n. occasionally.\n\nDo the 1st 10-15 scenarios where you get started with a fresh team\nalways seem to be the most difficult.  I admit dreading going to &quot;Tic\nand Tac&quot; and make it one of my last places to visit.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
