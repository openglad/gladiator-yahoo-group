I \nwent \n&gt;  through a maze phase where I made a few programs to generate \nrandom \n&gt;  mazes. I also made a maze generator for my TI89 calculator. :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I found some code that would generate a random maze in C. \n&gt; ( http://www.delorie.com/game-room/mazes/ ), but any other sources \n&gt; would help.  The big issue is making sure that the user can specify \n&gt; the width and height of the maze as well width and height of the \nwalls \n&gt;  and spaces between the walls in the maze.  I wouldn&#39;t mind looking \nat \n&gt; more samples of code though.  What other languages did you write \nthe \n&gt; random maze generating code?\n\n\n"}}
