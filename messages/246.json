It was also difficult to navigate on foot, slightly wider\npathways would help immensely (if possible).  I remember finally abondoning\ngoing up to the top, or whatever was supposed to be at the end, as going\nround in circles is not my idea of progress :)\n\nThe ocean without a boat scenario, I tried to play it but it only ever took\n1 hit to kill me.  I&#39;m not sure if this is the way the level was designed\n(ie - super-powerful monsters) or it was something to do with the game and\nbeing over the ocean.  An exit from that level would also be nice, I\ncouldn&#39;t see one on the minimap, and I thought it might be a good idea to\ninclude a link back to the dock you stepped off, we are swimming right?\nJust turn around and swim back :)\n\nAside from that, I think the rest were good, they had a reasonably linear\nplot and I especially like the garden of golden apples, I ran around it\nchecking out what I missed on the way through :)  Very nice idea.  There\narn&#39;t any design bugs I can remember, and many scenarios provided a\nchallenge - such as those where the NPC can&#39;t die, and said NPC starts\nsurrounded by not-so-happy nasties.  Clerics and mass-killing don&#39;t go well\ntogether :)  The door guard at one of the castles (knox?) was good too, an\ninvisible barrier that fights back, it goes some way towards realism (where\nyou&#39;d siege the door while taking damage), about as far as you probably can\nin the game.\n\nOverall I think they are excellent, it&#39;s good to see some levels roaming\naround, especially those that have very few problems.\n\nCya,\nDeathifier (David Storey)\n- Beware, midnight brings about incoherant mumbling as sure as the sun\nbrings warmth to the earth.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I think we can safely say that my levels DON&#39;T suck. I haven&#39;t been\ngetting\n&gt; much feedback, and the site has been getting almost no traffic, but\neveryone\n&gt; who&#39;s tried them (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html) seems to like\n&gt; them... Of course, for a permanent posting I would like to revise them one\n&gt; more time. Would someone other than DPH care to comment on them? At all?\n&gt; Just to say that you downloaded them? ...anyone?\n&gt;\n&gt;          -Tevildo, the unappreciated Prince of Cats.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
