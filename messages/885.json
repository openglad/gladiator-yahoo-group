I&#39;m asking so I can reserve my scenario numbers \nfor the gladiator tournament.  I have reserved all the numbers from \nwhere the Tyrx left off to #200 for myself.\n\n2)I would like to see us try to start the &#39;50 project&#39;.  In case \nanyone has forgotten, it was to be a team effort at creating 50 \nbrand-new scenarios for the game.  The scenarios were to be where you \ncould start from scratch and work your way through them.  If we can \nget 5 volunteers to start it, I will spearhead working on it.\n\n3)just out of curiosity, johnny, you aren&#39;t trying to create a team to \nrival my own would-be gods, right?\n\n\n"}}
