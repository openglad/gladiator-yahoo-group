I \nknow for myself that I have my map designed, but I just need to place \nall the characters.  Is 1 week extra week going to be long enough?\n\nI&#39;m also going to extend the deadline by one week for submitting \nthemes for the 2nd monthly scenario contest since I offered the only \nsuggestion.\n\n*Side issue*\nignore the rest of the message if not programmer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was side tracked trying to write a a VB program that just runs the \n&quot;smoothe&quot; program.  I have about 50% of the last function left to \ntranslate from C to VB.  A couple of statements like these have left \nme wondering:\n\nif (around == (TO_DOWN | TO_RIGHT | TO_UP)\n\nif (around == (TO_RIGHT | TO_UP))\n\nThe obvious translation doesn&#39;t seem quite right since neither \nTO_DOWN, TO_RIGHT, NOR TO_UP are boolean operators.  Other than that, \nI just got to weed through the nested if-then statements and \nselect-case statements.\n\n\n"}}
