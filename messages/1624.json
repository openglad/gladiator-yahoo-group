Boomerang really wasn&#39;t that strong of an attack and \nneither is whirlwind for the amount of mana used.\n\nElves are pretty cool, but at about level 30, they lose all their big \nweakness.  At level 30, hypothetically an elf could stay in the middle \nof a forest and continously attack opponents without the risk of being \nharmed because of mana production ability outweighs mana lost while \nstaying in a forest.\n\n\n"}}
