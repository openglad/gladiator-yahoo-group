I used to have it \nbut since\n&gt; I had to format my hard drive, I lost it and was unable to get it \nback\n&gt; because the link on the site doesn&#39;t seem to work.  If you do, \nspeak up\n&gt; and maybe you can send it over to me, I could mirror it on my FTP \nfor the\n&gt; FSGames site (I run off a cable modem).  Also, if you&#39;ve got it \nand don&#39;t\n&gt; want to spend the time looking me up, upload it to a xoom account \nor\n&gt; something and post the address to this list.  Someone has *got* to \nhave\n&gt; it.
