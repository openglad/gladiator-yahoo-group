I used to have it\nbut since\n&gt; I had to format my hard drive, I lost it and was unable to get it\nback\n&gt; because the link on the site doesn&#39;t seem to work.  If you do,\nspeak up\n&gt; and maybe you can send it over to me, I could mirror it on my FTP\nfor the\n&gt; FSGames site (I run off a cable modem).  Also, if you&#39;ve got it\nand don&#39;t\n&gt; want to spend the time looking me up, upload it to a xoom account\nor\n&gt; something and post the address to this list.  Someone has *got* to\nhave\n&gt; it.  Anyone? :)  (ICQ#: 18074806)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks guys, enjoy your weekend.\n&gt;      -Chris\n\nHey man, i a looking for the demo 2 for a long time. do you have it?\nand if you do could u send it to me by mail?\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
