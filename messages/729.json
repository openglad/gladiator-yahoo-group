That would put archmages and \nclerics more in check.\n\nI, also, propose increasing weaknesses of halfings.  Half-elf, for \nexample, would lose energy walking through trees faster than a regular \nelf.  Half-mages or half-archmages would be extremely vulnerable to \nthe attacks of faeries (multiply the effect of being froven in a place \nby a factor of 5 or higher compared to normal).\n\n\n"}}
