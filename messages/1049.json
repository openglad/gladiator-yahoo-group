He is more \nlikely to symathies with the revolution.\nhe is the only person in the city that is the same size as hightower and has \nhair of a bright blue. (i really have blue hair)\nprobably the charecters will meet him just because he stands out in the \ncroud so much or maybe they will meet him hired to guard something.\nhe is suprisingly smart for his position in life (suprisingly being \nrelitave, he&#39;s about average) and is always trying to be funny to a varying \ndigree of success.\nif asked he will tell you that his name is a long story (he really got it \nfrom a prank he once did with some friends inwhich he dressed up as an \nundead to try and scare away a shopkeeper, which didn&#39;t work. he also thinks \nit has a nice ring to it).\nhe would probably be considered a solder or a barbarian.\nif you need anything else just ask.\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n\nFrom: &quot;James Trahern&quot; &lt;4idlamo@...&gt;\nReply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nTo: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [gladiator] Characters in Gladiator_story.rtf\nDate: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 05:49:24 +0800\n\n &gt; i don&#39;t really need to be a dancing corpse, that could just be my \nnickname\n &gt; or something because no one knows my real name. definitely work for the\n &gt; badguys though. i could be some inforcerlike guy if you need one, i&#39;m \npritty\n &gt; open to use as you see fit. you could also use my name: terry.\n &gt; what site is this story at again?\n\nTerry? If you don&#39;t want to be an undead servant of Jakarta, I need a basic \ncharacter description attitude, reason for being there, etc. Check back on \nRory and oldschool&#39;s posts.
