I can&#39;t hardly wait \nto go through all scenarios.\n\nI noticed a few interesting things so far (so I cheated to get extra \nmoney to find these interesting things):\n\nWhy does an archer run after being close to lots of exploding bolts \nexploding? I had an archer up to 400 on everything but experience and \nhis experience level was 40. I was launching lots of exploding bolts \nclose to a wall and he started to run away on his own.\n\nAlso, I had slime upto 180 on everything but experience (experience \nlevel was 20). When I left a scenario I had only 15 team members of\nmy \n team, most were slime), I got ready to purchase another team member \nand I couldn&#39;t. I checked the view of my team and behold, the number \nof slimes had surpassed 30!!\n\nWho can do the most damage in a single attack to a character: archer, \ncleric, mage, archmage, fire elemental, or druid?\n\nI have a suggest new power for ghost: Possession. A ghost could \npossess the body of an ally or friend for a limited period of time \nand use the attacks of the possessed.  While the ghost is possessing, \n all damage is inflicted upon the body of the possessed.  If the\nghost \n is possessing a druid, all faeries produced are on the side of the \nghost.  If the ghost is possessing a cleric, all ghosts and skeletons \nproduced are on the side of the ghost or the ghost could use the \ncleric&#39;s resurrection ability to create a new body (of character type \nchosen by the ghost) for the ghost.\n\n\n"}}
