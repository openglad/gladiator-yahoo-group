I would go for some limitations on how far the range of great \ncloak works.

A good way to \nhandle mega bomb is to make it use a set percentage of the assasin&#39;s \nmana as opposed to a set amount of mana. \n\n[Yes, I&#39;m a real fan of linking mana used for an attack directly to \nhow much available mana a character has.]\n\n&gt; 3rd special: Steal equipment [disarms enemy and increases score]\n&gt; 4th special: Backstab [Either the fabled Insta-Death or a very large \n&gt; amount of damage, BUT it only works at hand-to-hand range (i.e. next \n&gt; to the poor sod it kills)]\n\nOther than a few objections, this sounds like a really good promotion \nfor a thief.\n\n\n"}}
