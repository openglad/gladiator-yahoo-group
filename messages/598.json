I think if someone wanted to run\nit in Linux they could probably use a windows emulator anyway.  It would\nbe a lot of extra trouble to write a dos version of the editor, and that\nI think is unnecessary anyway since pretty much everyone uses windows\ninstead of DOS.  It&#39;s ok that it&#39;s a DOS game anyway, the warcraft\neditor I&#39;m pretty sure was a windows application even though warcraft 2\nwas a DOS game.  \n\n\tThose editor specs look good to me.  Still waiting on someone to\nvolunteer to lead the project :).  I don&#39;t think I have the experience. \nI should be helpful in coding it though.  Haven&#39;t ever coded anything\nfor windows so that will be new for me but I&#39;ve done plenty of dos and\nweb stuff.  I think C++ might be the better choice because for something\nlike this it seems like an object oriented language is more\nadvantageous.  If any of you have a free C++ compiler that you have\nworking for making Win32 applications we should just use that so at\nleast one of us doesn&#39;t have to get a new compiler set up.  Hopefully\nsometime pretty soon I&#39;ll have some time to try this Borland C++\ncompiler out and see how easy it is to use.  \n\n\tOk that&#39;s all for now.  keep the ideas flowing and if anyone else wants\nto help out speak up :)\n\nBj�rn\n\n\n\nDeathifier wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; In this post I&#39;m trying to outline what info we have and get clarification\n&gt; on a few things so that everyone knows who is doing what in the design of\n&gt; the new editor and so that it doesn&#39;t just fade away like some other small\n&gt; projects I&#39;ve seen.\n&gt; \n&gt; There&#39;s just a small issue, windows native programs are not directly\n&gt; portable to other OS&#39;s due to the way they need to be built - we can\n&gt; definitely isolate and/or mark the code that is OS specific (mainly screen\n&gt; drawing code, system calls) to make it easier but people won&#39;t be able to\n&gt; just pick it up, put it on Linux, and compile it :)\n&gt; \n&gt; So we need to clarify something - do we want to make it somewhat easily\n&gt; portable to another OS?\n&gt; Seeing as Gladiator only runs on DOS I&#39;d say most people are either using\n&gt; DOS or windows, and you can actually class those as different OS&#39;s despite\n&gt; one being built ontop of the other (in most cases).\n&gt; Would everyone be happy with just a Win32 (native windows) version of the\n&gt; program?\n&gt; Has anyone actually done porting before, or coded with porting in mind\n&gt; (cause I haven&#39;t)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, if you want to be listed as either a critic (ie tester) or a\n&gt; programmer then post to the group, we have to pick someone to lead this and\n&gt; set it up/get it start and then have someone create a forum or mailing list\n&gt; for us to work in - as Bj�rn suggested.\n&gt; It would probably be best to get a website, or a least a few pages, built\n&gt; for the project as well so that people have a central place to go for the\n&gt; latest news, versions, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once we have the editor for V8 scenarios built we should consider adding in\n&gt; the option of converting other version scenarios up, that way we will have a\n&gt; complete replacement for scen.exe and editor.exe\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is anything I&#39;ve left out or people want to add then point it out\n&gt; on the list and I&#39;ll amend this info.\n&gt; \n&gt; Cya&#39;s,\n&gt; Deathifier\n\n"}}
