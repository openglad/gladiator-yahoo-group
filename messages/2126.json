By the time every map tile has been replaced with PIX_VOID, the specenario would effectively be over.\n\nI&#39;d also like to see some random events placed in the game.  At random, one of your opponents gets a +5 experience level boost - either temporary or permanent.  And some more unlikely events like giving an opponent short term invulvernability at random (random, not just which character, but random as whether or not to do it).  Things like that just kept the player off-balance will do wonders.\n-- \n___________________________________________________________\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com\nhttp://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\n\n\n"}}
