Have you taken a whack at the \nTevFifty yet? If not, please do, and don&#39;t use cheats. It should be \nentertaining... I just wish I could get my levels posted on the official \nGladiator page. Tom said that would be okay, as long as they don&#39;t suck... \nan interesting sentiment when the Tryxian Chronicles, located on the FSGames \nsite, is the crappiest set anyone here has ever seen. For now, they&#39;re still \nat http://uk.geocities.com/tevgames.\n\nYes, I&#39;ve played with a solo Druid, and there&#39;s no point to summoning \nfaeries UNLESS you plan to use them to draw the enemy&#39;s attention. If so, \nslap a few Protections on it and it&#39;s good to go. Druids are good as snipers \n(that lightning is fast, powerful, and long-ranged) as well as hand-to-hand \n(yeah, just get up close and personal and keep attempting to plant a tree \nwhere the enemy is standing). I can&#39;t think of any other character type \nthat&#39;s as well-rounded, with the possible exception of soldiers with \nboomerangs going all the time. And that&#39;s just nutty.\n\nDale, looking forward to seeing your levels.\n     -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
