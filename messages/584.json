A golem spins \nits body around, allowing it to temporarily go through trees and over \nwater.  The attack would hurt opponents who get hit by the golem and \nthis new attack would effectively make attacks against Golems count as \n1/2-1/4 their value.  Wait minute, why not give Golems a pinball mode \nattack.  All it would do is roll around and hit objecdts,  This attack \nwould give Golems incredible speed.\n\nGiant Skeletons - Definitely &#39;Split&#39; into 5-6 normal sized skeletons. \n No inspiration for an original attack.  Maybe if I had more sleep \n[it&#39;s not my fault, just the moron I live with], I might be able to \nthink of something.\n\nI believe in limiting each character to 4 attacks with possible \nalternates for each attack.  This will keep any character from \nbecoming too powerfull.\n\n\n"}}
