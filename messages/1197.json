Thus it seems\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; problem is not much of a problem at all. The reasonable choice,\n&gt; then,\n&gt; &gt; would be to make elves&#39; attacks weaker as they travel through\n&gt; &gt; forests, which makes sense as trees do not generally stand aside for\n&gt; &gt; rocks.\n&gt;\n&gt; That&#39;s what I think.  For really low experience levels, this effect\n&gt; would almost unnoticeable.  But at very high experience levels, the\n&gt; effect would be noticeable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Something like the attack loses a percentage of strength for every x\n&gt; amount of time it travels in a forest.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
