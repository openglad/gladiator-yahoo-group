Well, now I&#39;m going to host one. \nEveryone interested should join the yahoogroup &quot;glad-tourny&quot; \n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glad-tourny). I&#39;ll be posting the \nrules and mode of play in that group shortly. It&#39;ll be nothing \nextravagant, of course, but it will be an honest competition in the \nold-skool Gladiator 3.8 style. If all goes well, we should be ready \nto start very soon.\n   -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n\n"}}
