How so?  I \nadded a feature that allows the user to copy existing scenario to a \ndifferent scenario number and it works!!  \n\nI have been using this new function with some if-then statements to \nchange the locations of objects within a scenario, specifically &quot;The \nBrag&quot;.  Yep, I am giving that map a much needed face-lift by \nincreasing the thickness of outside walls and adding some more \nwalking space to various places.\n\nI know I have posted this twice before (apparantly yahoo has decided \nnot to let my posts come through), but here are my comments on Orc \nCaptains:\n\n1)Orc Captains should have an ability called &quot;Summon Formation&quot;.  \nThis would have a stronger effect than &quot;Summon Defense&quot;.  Also, \nweaker orcs might be enticed by this ability.\n\n2)It might be usefull to give Orc Captains the ability to throw nets \nover opponents.  This would have the effect of immobilizing the \nopponent into the net is destroyed.\n\n3)If an Orc is within some much distance of an Orc Captain on the \nsame team, the Orc should receive some benefits: increased accuracy, \nincreased hit points, etc..\n\n\n"}}
