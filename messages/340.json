I have seen enemy druids \nuse the spell of protection and summon faeries in my own scenarios.  \nThe only character I think that is severly deficient in its \nprogramming are slime.\n\nI had my entire team (1 mega powered archmage) mind controlled once \nand it lasted after the offending archmage was dead.  My team has been \neffected by enemy chain lightning in one of the original scenarios.  I \nhave seen enemy mages freeze time REPEATEDLY in a certain one of the \ntevfifty and one of my own scenarios has been accused of fostering \nmages that repeatedly freeze time.\n\nAdmittedly, I have not seen enemy archmages summon images or fire \nelementals.  However, those would be extremely to prove an enemy \narchmage would do so unless one created a scenario with 100% named \ncharacters and no monster generators.\n\nI have no my problems with any other mega powered characters except \nfaeries.  But faeries, ghosts, and sketelons are not likely to be \naround much once I complete this set and if you go through certain \nscenarios, you should understand my concern about facing faeries and \nghosts.\n\nWell, in most of my scenarios, there will be no NPCs.  But, if I do \nhave an NPC in my scenarios, the NPC will be sufficient to help you \nout in some problems. \n\nHowever, one slight note:  I have designed a scenario where a team \ncomposed entirely of clerics can NOT win [unless you are extremely \nlucky] and that scenario is on the main path.\n\nYes, I do realize some of my scenarios are not well suited for \narchers, but neither are certain ones of the tevfifty.\n\nI need opinions from more people on this subject of experience level \n15 and higher mages and archmages.\n\n\n"}}
