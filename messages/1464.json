The year was 1996 (maybe a few years earlier), and\nme and a friend of mine downloaded Gladiator off of AOL&#39;s share/freeware\ndownloads. It joined the C:&#92;Games directory with other titles such as\nQuest for Glory 1, Hubie, Civilization 1, Skyroads, Commander Keen:\nGoodbye Galaxy, and about a hundred other old old games. However, this was\nthe only game we had that was comfortably multiplayer, *and* you could\nmake levels! We played it religiously for about a month (instead of doing\nhomework and such :-) and got to the unregistered death level several\ntimes. After one of those times we finally decided to fork over our life\nsavings and buy the registered version. I was young and naiive then, so I\ndownloaded it onto a floppy which turned out to be corrupt. After 30 mins\non the phone with whoever I ordered it from (I think Albert&#39;s Amby), they\nsent me a copy via email.\n\nFor some reason I never knew about the registered password and stuff\nuntill now, though.\n\nAnyways, comfortable single-comp multiplayer and a level editor was what\nmade it great, along with great gameplay and story. It was the first game\nI saw with those features.\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
