It\nalso keeps the attack of resurrectioon,. but gets an alternate:\nreincarnation.  This new attack will allow the dead to come back as a\ndifferent character class and allow you to summon soliders from dead\nopponents.  Another possibility for attacks is shout curses [turn into\n  stone] at opponents.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
