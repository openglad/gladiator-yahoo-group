There is a \n&gt; (questionable) value to boomerang, once you have a ton of MP, but \n&gt; charge is clearly the best soldier ability.\n\ndisarm is pretty pointless, but whirlwind does become useful if you \nget really up there. i had a big soldier once in one of DPH&#39;s hedge \nlevels use like 4 whirlwinds and then just charge up and down empty \ncorridors for 10 minutes. whirlwind is also EXTREMELY useful if \nyou&#39;re fighting some superpowerful badguy, because they can&#39;t hit you \nif you keep making them go backwards.\n\nOldschool\n\n\n"}}
