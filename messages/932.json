If you place them in \norder from 7 to 1, the order in which you teleport is 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  \nDoes that help?\n \n&gt; I&#39;m not quite sure if that means the converter is not working right \n:)\n&gt; I take it the map file is whats open in the editor?\n&gt; *Looks confused*\n\nI placed all the teleporters using the scenario editor.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That brings me to another feature for the new scenario editor: \nability\n&gt; &gt; to take a set of teleporters and change the order in which they \nwould\n&gt; &gt; work.\n&gt; \n&gt; That sounds useful, especially for long chains, and it shouldn&#39;t be \nvery\n&gt; hard to do either.\n\nThe longest continous chain I&#39;ve put together was 20 and that was for \n&#39;The Weakest Link&#39; and &#39;The Weakest Link 2&#39;.  Going teleporter crazy \nis NOT a good idea unless there is an obvious pattern or you want to \nachieve the effect of a maze.\n\n&gt; I&#39;ve added it to the editor file and I&#39;ll clean it up and upload it \nto the\n&gt; groups downloads area so others can see it.\n\nCool.\n\n\n"}}
