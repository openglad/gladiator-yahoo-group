Worse\n&gt; problem: there are 8 \n&gt; &gt; teams in the scenario and each one has a mage\n&gt; capable of slowing \n&gt; down \n&gt; &gt; time.  How would that problem be handled?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another thing to consider is making the time slow\n&gt; down delay before \n&gt; &gt; using it again effect the entire team.  What if\n&gt; team 1 had 3 \n&gt; mages?  \n&gt; &gt; Effectively, team 1 could rotate out who slows\n&gt; down time to keep \n&gt; time \n&gt; &gt; indefinitely frozen.\n&gt; \n&gt; To avoid the problem of 8 different teams with time\n&gt; slowdown ability, \n&gt; maybe thay should ALL have it disabled for a few\n&gt; minutes after a \n&gt; slowdown.\n\nI see no reason for _any_ delay at all. If you have\nthree high-level magi and the enemy only has one, you\n_should_ be able to take advantage of your abundance\nof magi. (If you didn&#39;t switch to Archmage for a\nreason, that reason usually is Freeze Time.)\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
