I would have\ndone it several days ago, but I&#39;ve been extremely busy. Its not\nuserfriendly, but it can zoom, skip through frames, and edit? This pixie\neditor can be used to edit any .pix file. So any artists out there, you\ncan have at it :-). Download the latest from CVS, compile, and you&#39;re\nready to go.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\nOn Thu, 12 Sep 2002, Daniel Paul Hightower wrote:\n\n&gt; Damn, I found the source of one bug and discovered another one in the\n&gt; process dealing with grid names. :-( Unfortunately, that means the\n&gt; version I sent to Snowstorm has the 2nd bug in it.  Fortunately, both\n&gt; of those problems can be easily solved, but probably not before Friday\n&gt;  night.  The first problem can be solved by creating a global array\n&gt; and the second by string manipulation. :-)\n\n\n"}}
