We tried to \npick out the ones that were most game-affecting (things like freezing time \nfor an infinite duration, etc.), but there were always more that we just \nignored :) Eventually, we played through the levels &quot;normally&quot; several \ntimes, attempting to get stats as high as possible.  We made sure \neverything worked in those &quot;normal&quot; (ie, non-cheating, no \nspecial-levels-designed-for-exp-boosting) circumstances .. that way we \ncould make sure we&#39;d fixed anything players would find &quot;in the normal \ncourse of the game,&quot; and we figured that anything else, players could do \n(and experience) as they like ;-)\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
