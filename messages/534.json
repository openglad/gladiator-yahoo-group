Why\n15?  To make the effort somewhat worthwhile.  It will take several\nhours of work to get ready for the tournament (selecting\nscenarios and editing them/making new scenarios).  If any of my\nscenarios are to be used, they will have to edited to bring experience\nlevel of opponents and number of opponents down.\n\n**What&#39;s going on with Part 1?  What about the rest?**\nThis is going to be a four part discussion.  Part 1 is about the wish\nlist for a NEW scenario editor for gladiator.  Part 2 will be about a\nwish list for existing characters.  Part 3 will be about a wish list\nfor new characters and misc stuff.  Part 4 will be about the wish list\nfor Gladiator:Beyond Freedom, which I believe no person in this list\nhas played.\n\nI will ask replies to this topic be restricted to improvements for a\nnew scenario editor.  When I feel this topic is exhausted, I will\ncompile a list for a new scenario editor and start Part 2.\n\nHere&#39;s the first one:  Slow down feature for the mouse.  In a big\nscenario, it&#39;s too easy to move your mouse completely off screen from\nthe area you are working on.  Telvido, I expect you to have as many\nsuggestions about the scenario editor as I have.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
