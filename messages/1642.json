(IE: normal \n  arrow, but always insta-death)\n\n  I think it sounds cool, but it might unbalance the game. Also might \n  need to change explanation.\n\n  For the Orcs:\n\n  Berserk - An Orc with enough power can bring upon itself rage in \n  which it may destroy anyting that stands in it&#39;s way. (Like Charge, \n  but kills everything it hits, including your own side so be careful)\n\n  I&#39;d appreciate feedback, although neither of these is incredibly \n  likely to reach Openglad Enhanced or Gladiator: Beyond Freedom...\n\n\n\n  The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
