Python might be all that too, though\n&gt; (except small, but that&#39;s\n&gt; forgivable).\n\nAs far as I can tell, Lua *is* C/C++. Python is\nbasically C/C++/Java with leaner syntax, a *lot* of\ncaring about whitespace (this is a weakness that I am\nwilling to admit), really crazy container/group types,\nand generators thrown into the mix. It&#39;s really your\ndecision, and something that looks *exactly* like\nC/C++ would probably be easier for the general\npopulation.\n\n&gt; &gt; Sorry, I&#39;ve no SDL experience. ;-(\n&gt; \n&gt; Its not too late! Grab a book on SDL and get\n&gt; crackin&#39;! :-)\n\nI&#39;m moving into college (University of California\nIrvine, in the same city that Blizzard is in) in two\ndays. I know for a fact that the student discount\ndoesn&#39;t work on O&#39;Reilly books. ;-(\n\n=====\n&quot;That which is truly wisdom will seem like foolishness to a fool, and that which is truly foolishness will seem like wisdom to a fool.&quot;\n- Proverbs\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
