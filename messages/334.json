When I play a while with the game, the \nclock is even further ahead of real time when I look at it.  All other \nprograms do NOT cause this.  I have traced it down to the game \nGladiator.  I have been meaning to ask about this.  Can anyone explain \nwhy the game messes with the computer clock?  I upgraded from Windows \n3.1 to Win95, if that helps.  Am I the only way out there with this \nproblem?\n\n\n"}}
