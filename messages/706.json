(that&#39;s the othe thing i&#39;m working on, coding-wise.. nothing fancy, just the basic &quot;when do we talk here&quot; and &quot;who said how many lines&quot; functions will do, for now. Linking nicks is *PAINFUL*)\n\n&gt;Oh, how are the other programmers going with the editor task?\n\nGot the header information to load correctly, and added some testing functions to ensure that the grid file you load *IS* a gridfile, and that gridfile is a v7 or v8 gridfile... (tho i think i might be able to figure out the differences of earlier versions too)\n\nRight now, almost everything is in main() with limited useage of functions... mainly because I was coding off the top of my head for most of the header. It&#39;ll all be separated out into proper functions eventually. haven&#39;t touched it in a week.. and then i go away on vacation on the 3rd.. so it&#39;ll probably have to wait until the 11th, when i return. i&#39;ll have some net access but no compiler access during that time.\n\nlinked list for the objects looks to be the easiest way to handle them, just FYI.. though on some of those maps, there&#39;s like a billion objects! :/\n\n-George &quot;Cookie&quot; Phillips\nAnime News Network\nCo-Editor-In-Chief\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com\n\n\n"}}
