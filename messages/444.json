(Same with bone piles, BTW)\n\nWait a minute:  you surived the super-powered skeletons?  My small \narmy of Summoned Fire Elementals had troubles here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Level 401 was kind of sad, it was just gold piles and 12 level 1 \n&gt; faeries...\n\nThe point was to acquire $$$$$$$.\n&gt; \n&gt; Level 402... I just moved near the corner, held down enter...\n\nI never actually had the patience to take out the slime.  I waited \nand waited ...\n&gt; I agree with the restriction on Archmages, although not entirely on \n&gt; Clerics and Druids, however.\n&gt; \n&gt; Archmagi should only be able to have 1 fire elemental, because a \n&gt; level 150+ fire elemental summoned as soon as the battle starts \nmakes \n&gt; it a BIT unfair.\n\nOnly a BIT unfair?\n&gt; \n&gt; Clerics, however, need to actually acquire a kill before they can \nuse \n&gt; Ressurection, and Druids&#39; summoning abilities are totally \nworthless. \n&gt; Have you ever USED Druids? Faeries that are summoned are level 1 \nNPC \n&gt; faeries - in other words, they suck by the time you can chain-\nsummon \n&gt; them. Actually, I think that Druids&#39; protection needs restricted. \nYou \n&gt; can cast it so much that things totally blur out of existence, and \n&gt; cannot be hit with normal attacks for the next...100 hits. And I \n&gt; think even one Protection is enough to stop a horde of normal Orcs \n&gt; from ever being able to harm you, although I may be wrong on this.\n\nActually, those summoned faeries need to have experience levels in \nsome way tied to the druid&#39;s experience level:  like a exp level 50 \nDruid could summon exp level 10 faeries.\n&gt; \n&gt; In conclusion... Archmages should get 1 fire elemental pet at most, \n&gt; and I&#39;ll have to check Clerics&#39; ressurect before I pass judgment on \n&gt; it. (Is it based on ressurected unit level or on Cleric level?) \n&gt; Druids need a cap on Protections, and Orc Captains need to have the \n&gt; Orcs&#39; specials.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m finishing up my set of levels, but I&#39;m not going to disclose \nany \n&gt; details. Yet.\n\nJust remember:  Don&#39;t attempt to duplicate my work on creating level \nthat yield mega-characters.\n\n\n"}}
