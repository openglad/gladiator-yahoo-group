I&#39;m new to this list, but I guess we can jump right in?\n\n&gt; Should there be a maxium amount of health points a character can\n&gt; have?  I have had summoned images/fire elementals/raised\n&gt; skeletons/ghosts with health points listed as negative numbers.\n\nThere already is a maximum, I believe. If the amount of hp gets beyond\nsome number (I think 32k), it wraps down to negatives. The reason is that\nthey&#39;re probably using a signed integer for the hp (2^16 bits, half of\nthem negative), so the maximum hp can be 32768. After that, all the bits\nbecome 0 and there&#39;s a 1 out in front of the integer somewhere, and the\ninteger is read as all of the 0s (I think), making it -32768.\n\nAnyways, limiting that number to 30000 or so would make a lot of cheaters&#39;\nlives less confusing.\n\n&gt; Should there be a maximum amount of mana a character can have?  I have\n&gt; had summoned images/fire elementals/raised skeletons/ghosts with\n&gt; health points listed as negative numbers.\n\nI think mp is handled the same as hp.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
