Any \n&gt;pages will do, I&#39;m not looking for anything exclusive.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d really like to take a look at what maps other players have made, and \n&gt;also how they play -- the strategies they use.\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a page up at \n&gt;\n&gt;http://members.xoom.com/shayd/glad.html \n&gt;\n&gt;for those who are interested in looking.  It just has some strategy on \n&gt;clerics, mages, and thieves; no maps yet.  (Unfortunately all my good maps \n&gt;were erased when I had to format my hard drive, but I&#39;ll be making more.)\n&gt;\n&gt;-Chris\n&gt;  / Shayd\n\nI just wanted to say that Chris&#39;s site is very cool -- congrats! Great to know\nthere are such devoted users :)\n\nAs Chris said, if anyone does have sites, or know of others, mention them on\nthis list. I&#39;ll try to get a page up at some point with pointers to all the fan\nsites that we know of.\n\n--Tom\n\n \n\n---------------------------- \nTom Ricket \n&lt;mailto:tricket@...&gt;mailto:tricket@... \nForgotten Sages Games \n&lt;http://www.fsgames.com&gt;http://www.fsgames.com \n---------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n"}}
