I&#39;m adding a\n&gt; condition: no teams \n&gt; with archmages (since you can easily defeat 99% of\n&gt; scenarios just by \n&gt; summoning enough fire elementals) or mages (since\n&gt; you can easily \n&gt; defeat 99% of scenarios just by freezing time and\n&gt; then attacking).\n\nArchers and Thieves. Archers for using Explosive Bolt,\nThieves for creating a line of traps you can&#39;t pass so\nthat you don&#39;t dare engage in melee combat.\n\nWhen I try to do solo games (pretty hard), I tend\ntowards Thieves, because then I can hurt the enemy\nwhile running away at the same time.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo!
