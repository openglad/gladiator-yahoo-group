If there are any other complete sets [that are \nnot being worked on] out there, tell me where they are.\n\nI am not sure that even a beginning team could take on all the \nscenarios in the tevfifty [my own legitimate team had trouble with a \ncouple of scenarios and it had been through all known existing \nscenarios] and I know for a fact that no beginning team would have \nsnowball&#39;s chance in the rain forest of beating the Tryx Chonicles.\n\nMy own levels are for the opposite purpose you have described.  They \nare designed to build up a team to a certain point [a point in which \nno one should attempt to go beyond], but using a beginning team in my \n1st scenario would be result in a guaranteed loss.\n\nIn some of my scenarios, extra temporary characters would prove very \nhelpfull.\n\nTo me, the point is to play with the same team as long as possible and \nsee how well you can do compared to others.  Right now, the least \nexperience level of my 100% legitimate team is 33 (the mage has it) \nand I am working on trying to bring him upto experience level 50 [the \nrest of my team has long past that point].\n\n\n"}}
