As it currently stands, if a ghost \n&gt; catches one of us in a corner, it&#39;s just escape, restart, because \n&gt; there&#39;s no hope of ever getting unscared.  Seems foolish, so I can&#39;t \n&gt; imagine it&#39;s that way if you play &quot;properly.&quot;\nWhen I used to play the game (too busy with school now) I remember that I did \nhave to cycle through my chars. to get unfrozen, but also, later in my \nplaying, I found out you could press in the same direction that the character \nis running scared.  I can&#39;t remember if you have to be running then push the \ndirection you&#39;re running in or you have to be running against a \nwall/tree/rock/etc.\n\n&gt; 7) What exactly do the various stats do?  Especially dexterity, which \n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to change walking speed very much; the others have \n&gt; their &quot;obvious&quot; effects -- more MP, more HP, less damage taken, more \n&gt; damage inflicted -- but does intelligence effect spells?  Etc.\nIntelligence:  I think this increases the speed your MP restores (in certain \ncases somehow I thought that it also increased potency, not sure now though)\nDexterity:  This increases the speed your HP restores.\n \n&gt; 2) Is there any way to patch the game to add new classes, or to make \n&gt; the classes more interesting?  Right now, the Mage is really the only \n&gt; one who gets increasingly complex as you level up.\nThere isn&#39;t a way... yet.  However, what you can play around with are the \ngraphics with the &quot;editor.exe&quot; file.  I remember a few years back when I \nplayed around with this.  I think I did a zelda theme and a pokemon theme.  \nIt was quite interesting.  Link was the soldier, a faery was the faery \n(didn&#39;t see that one coming did ya?), Ganon was the golem, Zelda was the \ncleric, so on and so forth.  Then in the pokemon version I just put various \npokemon as the characters.  It took a while to do, esp. the documentation \npart of it (I wanted to write a text document with ALL files in \n&quot;graphics.001&quot; and to where each one was used in the game, that way I could \nCOMPLETELY change the theme of Gladiator [even the title screen!])  If anyone \nis interested I will be compelled to find the file on my computer and upload \nthat file into the group.\n\n--Triple Threat Topspiner Tristan\n\n"}}
