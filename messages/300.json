It \nseems to me that that would be a really interesting project... I just \nfinished a story involving my character in the Two Towers LPMud \n(http://angband.com/towers), and sometime next week I&#39;ll start writing a \nstory with Torvald (levels 5 and 6) and Neldwyn (level 6) from the original \nGladiator scenarios. If several people wrote Gladiator stories, I doubt \nthere would be a problem with posting them on the Gladiator page at Onelist. \nI&#39;m perfectly willing to post other people&#39;s stuff on my levels download \npage (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html), too... scenarios, art, \nwhatever.\n\nI just ask that no-one else use Torvald and Neldwyn as characters, at least \nuntil I finish my story. That way I won&#39;t get any extraneous influences from \nother people&#39;s writing. Talk to you later.\n           -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\nHmm, speaking of the Two Towers, I&#39;ve been making webpages for a player \ngroup from there... I&#39;d appreciate any hits and guestbook signings. Sorry \nfor the plugs, and thanks a lot. \n(http://members.internettrash.com/smokers_guild or \nhttp://welcome.to/smokers_guild)\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
