However, \nI ran into a problem.\n\nwell, I&#39;ll give you an example.  I have been testing my random object \ngenerator using the grid map for scenario 150 - According to the \nbuilt-in scenario editor, dimensions are 1264 by 1248 or 79 frames by \n78 frames.\n\nExtracting the information from the file according to what you said, I \nread the scenario is actually 83 by 83. (I can also verify that by \nnoticing that all the objects placed in the new scenario conviently \nfit in that box of 83 by 83.)  [Unless another bug has shown up.  Damn \nit, I have read 6 different scenarios to have that same size 83 by 83 \nso I may be dealing with another bug; I keep getting a value of &quot;70&quot; \nfor that first byte.]\n\nAlso, because that information is 1 byte for x size of frames and y \nsize of frames, assumedly, that will need to be mutlipled by some \nfactor, probably 16, to determine real x and y max values.\n\n\n"}}
