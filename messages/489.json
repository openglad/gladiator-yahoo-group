which give you a lot of money at the end of a \nChampaign for doing the whole campaign (by campaign i mean a group of \nscenarios like the tevfifty) this could be stretched but you might want to \nbegin with a teleporter maze that the last scenario tells you how to get \nthrough so no-one just skips to the $$$ scenario\n\n5)make them interesting and not just impossible\n  if it&#39;s just monsters banging they&#39;re heads against you and nothing for \nyou to do but hit the fire key this get a bad rating (or level or number or \nwhatever) but if you actually make choices by having different goals or \ndifferent means of achieving a goal or if there is something that makes the \nscenario unique then this gets a good, um, thing. if everyone makes 50 of \nthese levels then we&#39;ll run out of ideas so if anywhere between 1/3 and 2/3 \nof ones scenarios are like this that suffices\n\nwell that&#39;s it, just giving my ideas,\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\nps. tev i just found out what your name means for the 1st time (ain&#39;t it \nlame of me that it took me so long?)\n\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot;

from tevfifty and &#39;The Cellars&#39; from tevfifty.\n\n2)mobility - wide enough spaces to allow either a large slime or a\nfire elemental go through fairly easily.  biggest examles of one that\ndoesn&#39;t fit: &#39;The Labrinth&quot;\n\n3)quirks - negative factors.   for example, in most of my scenarios,\nchain lightning can&#39;t be used without waiting forever.\n\nIf there are more factors for evaluation of individual scenarios, let\nus add them.\nWhat I propose doing for large sets of scenarios is voting in a poll\n[after the scenarios are completely debugged] on existing factors plus\na few more such as ability to produce a theme.  Afterall, what keeps\nthis game going right now is creation of new scenarios and rating new\nscenarios we go appears to be beneficial.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
