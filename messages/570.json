The only thing I would want is aceess to an uncompiled \nversion of the new scenario editor.  In fact, if possible I suggest we \nleave full access to uncompiled version for anyone who wants it.\n\n2)I volunteer to be a tester.  If it is possible to crash the program, \n I will find a way.\n\n3)I would propose the new program be worked on in various versions, \njust to make it easier to test.\n\nFor example, \n\nversion 1.0 would have basic functionality: ability to put objects on \na grid, ability to resize a grid, etc.\n\nversion 1.1 would have smooth-out grid features.  It would also have a \n basic find/search-and-replace/search-and-delete features for objects. \n It would also allow you to find/search-and-replace specific tiles on \nthe grid.  You would also be able to look up where a teleporter heads \nto in this version.\n\nversion 1.2 would have a full featured find/search and replace/search \nand delete feature for objects.\n\n\n"}}
