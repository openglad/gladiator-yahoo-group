Tents placed in a \nforest won&#39;t work.  Also, I don&#39;t appreciate my team members being \nplaced inside rocks, forest, etc where they lose health points right \noff the bat.  Also, all scenario numbers above 409 won&#39;t work on my \nPC.  Do you manually edit those scenario files?\n\n3)in general, high experience level mages and archmages are a VERY BAD \nidea.  In the case of mages, they can freeze time: for opponent mages, \nthis allows your opponents to beat you without having a chance; for \nfriendly mages, this sure makes it easy to run out of mana really \nquick.  In the case of archmages, chain-lightning can quickly short \ncircuit any scenario.  Also, mind-control can became abused by making \nthe last opponents team mates.\n\n4)NPC help - in general, please don&#39;t provide a literal 30+ army to \nassist my team.  It can cause potential problems if you are facing \nenemy archmages (see above) and makes it that much harder for me to \nscroll through my own hired troops.\n\nNo offense, but these scenarios need more work done on them.\n\n\n"}}
