If they have enough \nint/level etc then they don&#39;t lose mana in forests, but they can&#39;t \nregenerate in forests even if they have the level/int. So, they can fire off \na full mana bar of rocks and then they can either stay in there and not \nattack or brave coming out.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nJoin the worldï¿½s largest e-mail service with MSN Hotmail. \nhttp://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
