I have decided that true torture would be \na level with 4 level 100 slime.\n\nWhy do when slime multiply, the new slime become a permanen part of \nyour team but when your cleric raises undead, they do not become a \npermanent part of your team?  If I could keep them, I would transfer \nall my undead unto a team by themselves.\n\nIs there any way to control what kind of image an archmage summons?  \nThis may sound dumb, but how logically can a cleric raise a ghost or \nskeleton from a dead image?\n\nCan anyone tell me what scenario numbers have been taken?  I was \nthinking about downloading all the user-created levels and if I did \nnot see scenarios like I wanted, creating my own scenarios.  I would \ncall my saga &quot;The Extreme Challenges&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
