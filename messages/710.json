It took me about 3 weeks to get used to a \nnormal trackball so go figure about this one.\n\n&#39;Halflings&#39; is the best name I could come up with.  Other names could \nbe &quot;half-breeds&quot; and &quot;nature&#39;s mistakes&quot; [somehow, I doubt those two \nnames would be popular].  &#39;Halfings&#39;, also, in the universe of \nGargoyles the tv show, refers to people who are half fey and half \nhuman.\n\nUnless we want to start creating new words, I suggest we stick to \n&#39;halfings&#39;.  But if you are taking about 1 specific set of halfings: \nhalf-archmage and half-cleric, just refer to them as half-clerics and \nhalf archmages.\n\n\n"}}
