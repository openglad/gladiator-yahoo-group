Please leave a blank line after you finishing a line or make \nit obvious where the quote ends and your opinion begins.  Just because \nyou&#39;re responding to a message does not mean you have to quote the \nentire message.  Just keep the parts you are responding to and leave \nout the rest.\n\nCongrats, we&#39;ve just tripled our previous record for number of \nmessages posted in a month and the number of messages posted this \nmonth is greater than the total number of messages posted in the \nprevious 6 months.\n\n\n"}}
