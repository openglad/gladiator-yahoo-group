And reveal is useless \nin a fast paced level where taking a look at the TINY minimap to find \ninvisible guys is a total waste of time. Reveal should dispell all \ninvisiblity spells in the surrounding area and reveal the stuff on \nthe minimap. Faerie spell is good, but the faerie you summon never \nget better than level one, which is useless when fighting high level \nguys that can kill them twice as fast as you can produce them. The \nfaeries should gradually get better as the druid level increases.\n\nSummon Golem - Druids were masters of the land, as there ultimate \nspell they should be able to summon golems\n\nBTW- The trees over crowding the level only becomes a problem when \nthe druid gets past about lvl 20. Then the trees are really strong.\n\nFaeries- Does little to no damage, now that it cant fly through walls \nthey are fairly useless to actually BUY\n&lt;To actually play they need some high damage spells.&gt;\nI also think the &quot;carry&quot; spell that someone suggested earlier would \nbe a good idea.\n\nFaerie Fire - A bolt of fire that does damage to the enemy over time \n(like a posion)\n\nSlime - A spell that change the enemy it hit to a slime (keeps the \nsame stats) for a limited time\n\n\nTriknight\n\n\n\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower \n&lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt;&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Um, except for the bug (I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a bug, at\n&gt;  least) which causes a faerie to be able to stun a\n&gt;  high-level character infinitely with a single hit, it\n&gt;  seems as if I can always get out of a faerie stunning\n&gt;  me.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is recovering from the first hit takes a long time.  \n&gt; Meanwhile, I got hit a second time.  Once I&#39;m hit the second time \n&gt; while being frozen from the first hit, I might as well be down for \nthe \n&gt; count.  Basically, any exp level 1 faerie becomes a high level \nthreat \n&gt; to any mages/archmages on my team.  So that translates to saying \nany \n&gt; druid capable of summoning faeries is a high level threat. (For \nreal \n&gt; fun, go through my Weakest Link II from dph&#39;s scenarios with a high \n&gt; level mage; you better hit the ground running if you don&#39;t want to \nget \n&gt; frozen by a faerie.)\n&gt; \n&gt; [Side note: I really like being able to point to a specific \n&gt; scenario(s) to illustrate a point.]\n\n\n"}}
