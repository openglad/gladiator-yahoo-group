Resurrect works.\n\nYou cast it on the shield?\n\n&gt; With a one player team, cycling through undoes the effect \n\nHmm...\n\n&gt; Hehe.  &quot;Tic and Tac&quot; is the hardest level by far in my book.  It&#39;s \n&gt; because the experience levels of those opponents are so high.\n\nThis level is pretty easy so long as you make the elves fight \nJakarta&#39;s men.  If you try to brute force it, it&#39;s a real meat \ngrinder.  I suppose with a large army you can&#39;t control your men well \nenough to hold back, though.\n\n&gt; At least now you can download a version of Gladiator:Beyond \nFreedom.  \n&gt; visit http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gladiator/files/Alpa/ to \ndownload \n&gt; the files for that program.\n\nThis is the same alpha that&#39;s been around on the FSGames site for a \nwhile, right?  I remember finding it unplayable -- doesn&#39;t it run \nsuper fast or something?\n  \n&gt; No.  We had a pretty good discussion a while back about adding new \n&gt; abilites to characters and expanding character classes.\n\nThat&#39;s too bad.\n  \n&gt; I would recommend to try the tevfifty first.  After that, \n&gt; try mine (dph&#39;s scenarios).\n\nDo these start on Level 1, or are they &quot;play after you beat the \ngame&quot; -- by level 1 I mean troops @ level 1, not scenario 1.\n \n&gt; We&#39;re also working on getting a gladiator tournament ready.\n\n?  How would that work?\n\nHow many people still subscribe to this list, btw?\n\n\n"}}
