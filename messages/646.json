An area heal\n(wide area, say a few character widths or maybe 1/2 the screen width) or\nchanging the advanced heal such that using the normal heal will only heal up\nto the max normal HP of the  target character, but advanced can heal up to\n150% or so, enabling them to engage more powerful targets on their own.\n\nJust some alternatives.\n\n- Deathifier\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;dancing corpse&quot; &lt;dancing_corpse@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 9:40 PM\nSubject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 3\n\n\n&gt; i was thinking of just a heal that gave more pur mp but you&#39;re right that\n&gt; would be better\n&gt;\n&gt; _,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n&gt; ���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n&gt; -Terry\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;Deathifier&quot; &lt;storey@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; To: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 3\n&gt; Date: Sat, 23 Jun 2001 21:35:31 +1000\n&gt;\n&gt; Heal is already pretty good, how about area heal?\n&gt;\n&gt; - Deathifier\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Donna Der&quot; &lt;TheLegendaryLight@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, June 23, 2001 8:56 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 3\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; to complete my table i need a lvl 4 attack for the High Priest (i put\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; petrify at 6 and resserect/reincarnate at lvl 6 and 10 because i\n&gt; thought\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; they were both too good for lvl 4)\n&gt;  &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; _,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; ���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n&gt;  &gt; &gt; -Terry\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; How about Greater Heal, a little better heal then standerd healing\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
