This program shoots two different different \nkinds of files:\n\n1)a file exactly like the existing scenario converter\n2)a file that tries to make all that data meaningfull.\n\nConverting the 1st type of file back into scenario file will be \nexceptionally easy.  I&#39;ll have to provide documentation to make the \n2nd type work.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
