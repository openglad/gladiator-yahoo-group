I agree with the time slowdown rather than stop, but also to add a mana halt, which would prevent all of the opposing team units from regenerating mana temporarily.  In conjunction these would be very powerful yet prevent complete frustration, as the player(s) on the other team(s) would still be able to move and shoot, just with temporary restrictions.  Also I think that the timestop/mana halt should take percentages from the casting unit&#39;s max mana amount rather than a defined amount to help maintain balance and fair play. Also I think a delay added should be added to the two spellsso the caster cannot use them again immediately after they wear off.\n  - David\n \n &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt; wrote:\nI&#39;ll add I have 2 possible solutions, which we&#39;ll discuss later: \nhandicapping scenarios by disabling the use of certain attacks and an \nalternate attack - slow down time.\n\nSlow down time would have your opponents functioning at half speed \nwith your team going normal speed.  Mana would be regenerated at half \nspeed during that period.  You could still defend yourself, but your \nopponents would have an advantage.\n\nOf course, another alternative is rewriting the code so that a team \ncan only wipe so many health points on each opponent while time is \nfrozen.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
