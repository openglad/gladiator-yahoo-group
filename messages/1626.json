Boomerang really wasn&#39;t that\n&gt; strong of an attack and\n&gt; &gt; neither is whirlwind for the amount of mana used.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also found whirlwind not to be too useful.\n&gt; Usually when I&#39;m in a\n&gt; situation that requires the use of whirlwind, I use\n&gt; charge to get out.\n&gt; However, boomerang is one of my favorite abilities.\n&gt; Its especially\n&gt; powerful when you can launch several at once and\n&gt; when you&#39;re fighting a\n&gt; big crowd. It is kinda useless when you&#39;re trying to\n&gt; hit far away (only\n&gt; hits at like 40 degree intervals or something, so\n&gt; the farther away your\n&gt; target is, the less likely you are to hit it), but\n&gt; up close it can cause\n&gt; lots of pain. Boomerangs can also go through walls\n&gt; and trees, which is\n&gt; rather unrealistic/unfair but is a useful\n&gt; bug/feature.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Elves are pretty cool, but at about level 30, they\n&gt; lose all their big\n&gt; &gt; weakness.

This could possibly be remedied by having an\n&gt; elf not regain mana\n&gt; while walking through trees, and making mana drain\n&gt; at a rate of a certain\n&gt; percent of total mana per second rather than a set\n&gt; number. Other than the\n&gt; tree walking, though, I find elves rather boring.\n&gt; All they have are\n&gt; variations of rock abilities. One of these days, I\n&gt; will get unlazy and\n&gt; think of some good abilities to sugest.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, having said all that, I think characters\n&gt; like elves (and\n&gt; archmages, although I guess that&#39;s for a later week)\n&gt; are too powerful at\n&gt; high (read: 100+) levels. I just played a scenario\n&gt; where all I did was\n&gt; megarocks until they cleared everyone out. This goes\n&gt; for soldiers, too. At\n&gt; very high levels they can just surround themselves\n&gt; with boomerangs and\n&gt; charge through pretty much anything. All that can\n&gt; probably be remedied\n&gt; by giving a maximum amount of things a character can\n&gt; control at a time\n&gt; (ie, rocks, boomerangs, and other things like that).\n&gt; \n&gt; There also seems to be a bug that makes some rocks\n&gt; stay infinitely in the\n&gt; game. Its not really a discussion topic, but oh well\n&gt; :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - Zardus\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n________________________________________________________________________\n&gt;\n________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
