Simply put if a value would cross over \nfrom positive to negative values, the value becomes automatically set \nat the maximum.\n\nOne strong suggestion is that in the future, make it possible for a \nplayer to see what scenarios numbers that team has beat.\n\nMy other suggestion would be to separate experience levels into the \nwhole part (the experience level) and the fractional part (the amount \nof experience above that level).  I found that at really high levels \n(200 and up), I could only spend enough money to go up 10 experience \nlevels at a time without resetting.\n\nOn the scenario level editor, I would suggest making it impossible to \ncreate anything (opponents, potions, etc) higher than level 1023.  As \nmuch as I am against placing limits, in order to keep characters from \ngaining too much experience and too much money which causes the game \nto crash, some limits have to be in place.  I would also like the \nscenario level editor to be able to let my copy an object and paste it \nsomewhere else.\n\n\n"}}
