Fwd: Congratulations !\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that &quot;you do not run programs that you recieve via e-mail\nunless you are EXPECTING TO RECIEVE it and know EXACTLY what it is supposed\nto do.&quot;\n\nSounds like a virus to me.\n\nSo, curious, I took a peek at the hexdump of the program... it calls\nkernel32.dll, user32.dll, gdi32.dll, comctl32.dll ... but masks those\ncontents when viewed with QuickView.\n\nSounds like a virus to me again.\n\nThere are _NO_ textstrings in the program at all. I don&#39;t know about you,\nbut trying to &quot;ask qustions&quot; without WRITING anything is rather difficult.\nJust to make sure, I checked glad.exe, and a handful of others..\n\nIt&#39;s possible that the text is encrypted/encoded somehow, but that sounds\nsuspicious anyways.. why would you bother for something like this? It makes\nno sense from a programmer&#39;s perspective.\n\nVirus again.\n\nIf you don&#39;t think it&#39;s a virus and you run it and it ISN&#39;T a virus, then\nyou&#39;re acknowledging that you want to defraud gamesdomain.com anyways...\nwhich is illegal anyways.\n\nTherefore, it is in _EVERYONES BEST INTREST_ to delete the file gdlott.exe\nfrom your hard drive.\n\nThank you for your time, and i hope &quot;-Tevildo. &lt;tevildo@...&gt;&quot; has a\ngood explanation for this. :P\n-Cookie\n\n&gt;Can anyone make use of this? Of course, I&#39;m not suggesting that anyone \n&gt;actually misuse this forward in violation of the original intent... Consider \n&gt;it &quot;for research purposes only&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Brian O&#39;Rourke&quot; &lt;lottery@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Subject: Congratulations !\n&gt;&gt;Date: Mon, 17 Jan 2000 14:36:32 -0800 (PST)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Your e-mail address is one of the few winner-addresses\n&gt;&gt;in the GamesDomain E-mail FREE GAME lottery.\n&gt;&gt;Your prize is a free game package (random title), $49 of value.\n&gt;&gt;The only thing you have to do is to execute the program\n&gt;&gt;attached to this message, fill all needed information fields\n&gt;&gt;and click on the Submit-button.\n&gt;&gt;Note that although the package is free you must pay the shipping tax.\n&gt;&gt;For best security credit card checking is made off-line so\n&gt;&gt;be sure that all information you enter is correct.\n&gt;&gt;CREDIT CARD FRAUD WILL BE SEVERELY PROSECUTED !\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;http://www.gamesdomain.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
