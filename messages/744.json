Possible for us with no source?  nope.  In fact I&#39;m\n&gt; pretty sure I couldn&#39;t do it even with the source.  It would require\n&gt; patching the game, probably pretty much rewriting a large portion of it\n&gt; even I suspect or the folks at fsgames would already have done it.  It\n&gt; would be cool, but I think I can safely say there is absolutely no\n&gt; chance of it happening.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; couldn&#39;t you write a small R.A.T., that only lets you control certain keys.\n&gt; that way you&#39;d get around having to rewrite most of Gladiator.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
