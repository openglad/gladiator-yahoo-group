I am currently working on a set of levels (about 12-15), and when I finish them I will create the website.  Again, if anyone has any levels, feel free to email them to me, and I will make sure they go up on the website for others to check out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I noticed there was a graphics editor included w/ the game.  Anyone ever tried creating new monsters?  Is it possible, or can you only modify existing creatures?\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; To unsubscribe from this mailing list, or to change your subscription\n&gt; to digest, go to the ONElist web site, at http://www.onelist.com and\n&gt; select the User Center link from the menu bar on the left.\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n"}}
