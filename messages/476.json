In fact, I never got \naround to it because the potions of speed ran out BEFORE I killed all \nthe faeries and I didn&#39;t have a prayer of taking out those faeries \nanytime soon.\n\nAbout that thief - The thief had no trouble.  Aside from my opinion \nthat if I wanted to kill my character, I should choose one where I \nhave a chance of escaping the explosion [reference to Archer], \nsome things have changed.I can remain cloaked the whole time and take \nout a small army.  Anchoring a poison cloud to a castle entrance and \nthen taunting the enemy equals easy victory.  The Mega-Thief (like all \nother mega characters except Archmage) couldn&#39;t take out my \nslime-gods.  A thief is a suicidal character.\n\nThat brings me to a point:  entrances to castles should be wide enough \nthat a thief can&#39;t anchor a couple of poison clouds to the sides and \ntaunt and take out all the opponents.\n\n\n"}}
