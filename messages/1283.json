This \nwould work something like &quot;Summon Defense&quot;, but much, much stronger.  \nReally weak opponent orcs might be enticed by this &quot;Summon Formation&quot; \nattack.\n\n2)orcs should be receive some benefits from being near an orc captain \nof the same team.  Otherwise, why call it &quot;Orc Captain&quot;?  Some of the \nbenefits could be increased accuracy, increased hit points, etc . . \nenough to justify having both an orc and orc captain on the team.\n\n3)Throwing a net over an opponent to immobilize the opponent would be \na great attack for an orc captain.\n\n10:02am Monday morning in case this post gets delayed.\n\n\n"}}
