We just \nneed to generate the terrain and the dudes.\n\nI set up the forms neccesary to allow the user to have control over \nwhat type of characters (living family) to place in the scenario [so \nyou could randomly populate with just soldiers or with golems and \ntowers] and what types of treasures (treasure family) to place in the \nscenario.  I plan on running a test pretty soon to ensure the code for \n the randoming choosing works in coordination with the forms.\n\nOn the other hand, I finally found the one section of source code I \nhave been hunting: the code [ void viewscreen::view_team(short left, \nshort top, short right, short bottom) ] that controls the display of \nteam stats while you are playing a scenario.  I plan on doing \ncalculations to readjust the spacing of information in the table after \nI study that section of code for a while.  When I think I have it \nright to make the spacing work, I&#39;ll email to you guys. [I am going to \nsummon a fire elemental since his stats take up the most space and use \nthat to determine how to readjust the spacing to prevent overlap.]\n\n\n"}}
