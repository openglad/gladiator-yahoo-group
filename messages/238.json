Like I said before, I will be working on creating\n&gt;scenarios to boost a team up to the point where a legitimate team\n&gt;composed of at least 2 members can beat it.  Right now, I am sending\n&gt;my slightly legitimate team through the tevfifty and see if they end\n&gt;up\n&gt;strong enough to beat my extreme level.\n\nI&#39;ve found that after defeating the two really tricky levels from the \noriginal set (Jakarta&#39;s Gates and the Manor Interior), tevfifty isn&#39;t really \nthat tough. So set the difficulty to Slaughter to gain the most experience, \nbringing it down for the scenarios you just can&#39;t do at that level. The last \ncouple are fairly nasty. Also, there is one inherent weakness in the \nlevels--see if you can find it. I tried to even it out as much as possible, \nbut there&#39;s still a major problem (which basically exists in all Gladiator \nlevels). Anyhow, is anyone other than DPH going to download my levels?? Not \nto brag or anything, but they kick Tryx&#39;s ass and are probably as good as \nthe originals.\n\nDPH, let me give you some advice: resist the temptation to use too many \ncharacter generators. Hitting the generator itself doesn&#39;t give you too much \nexperience, and using more than a handful (especially bonepiles and \nhigh-level mage towers) can make the level unplayable for many character \ntypes. Most really good levels I&#39;ve seen used a lot of ordinary humans, \nwithout too many blobs as major enemies. These have to be playable by \nnon-magic users too...   I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re going to use different \nmaps. I&#39;m sick to death of Scen0001, as it shows up EVERY time I start \nScen.exe. Making maps is a lot of fun when you get the hang of it.\n\nShayd, are you making any levels? I thought you were going to, and the one \nscenario of yours I saw showed promise....\n\nTom, Tom, where are you? Just out of curiosity, how did David Chan get Tryx \nposted on the real Glad page? I&#39;m sure there are some players that aren&#39;t on \nthe mailing list, and they won&#39;t know about any new levels coming out...\n\n       -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n           (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html)\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
