Some of them are great duelists. Some of \n&gt; them would be best served by surrendering before the battle begins.\n&gt; \n&gt; Soldiers - Usable for dueling, but tends to lose. Whirl is good for \n&gt; fearing the enemy if you&#39;re under artillery fire of some sort, but \n&gt; doesn&#39;t really last long enough to do anything. Disarm requires you \n&gt; to get to melee range, which is unlikely in duels. However, \n&gt; Boomerang does massive damage at high levels and Charge lets you \nget \n&gt; close enough that your boomerangs hit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Barbarian - If you give up and stand still, your death will be \n&gt; faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Elf - If the map has deep, deep woods, you could hide in the woods \n&gt; and be really evil/cheap against most classes. Otherwise, Elves are \n&gt; only good for setting up &quot;traps&quot; of huge amounts of rocks in maps \n&gt; with enclosed areas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Archer - Much better in open maps, where exploding bolt can be used \n&gt; indiscriminately. In enclosed spaces, settle for Barrage. One of \nthe \n&gt; most powerful dueling classes, if not the most powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mage - Freeze Time if you&#39;re on Team 1 and your friend won&#39;t shout \n&gt; at you for it. Otherwise, Warp Space to do damage and Teleport if \n&gt; you&#39;re about to eat 100 Exploding Bolts.\n&gt; \n&gt; ArchMage - Their normal attack is insanely powerful. If you&#39;re NOT \n&gt; opposing a Thief or ArchMage, Summon Elemental to create a level-\n150 \n&gt; NPC Elemental is usually instant win. If elementals are coming \nafter \n&gt; you, use Mind Control, summon your own, and/or run. Don&#39;t try Mind \n&gt; Control against a single enemy, though - it will usually just get \n&gt; you killed anyway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clerics - If there are high-level corpses sitting around on the \nmap, \n&gt; feel free to ressurect them. Against undead, I&#39;d assume you could \n&gt; Turn them. Otherwise, you have to hope for getting to melee range \n&gt; and using Mystic Mace.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thief - At high levels, Cloak has nearly-infinite duration, which \n&gt; makes it a lot harder for the enemy to find you. Poison Cloud can \nbe \n&gt; used in enclosed areas to set up traps and Charm can turn those \n&gt; level-150 NPC Elementals against the enemy. Bombs, however, are a \n&gt; Thief&#39;s main weapon, allowing one to do an absurd amount of damage \n&gt; if the enemy is caught in a bomb trap. My favorite dueling class.\n&gt; \n&gt; Druids - I&#39;ve heard from my friend that Grow Tree is also a death \n&gt; spell, but I&#39;ve never tried it. Protection is utterly useless \n&gt; against most forms of attack people will use. Summon, however, is \n&gt; great. It summons level-1 faeries that die in one hit... but if \nthey \n&gt; hit the enemy, they&#39;re stunned forever.\n&gt; \n&gt; Orc - I suppose you could run at the enemy Howling. Fear explosive \n&gt; bolts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fire Elemental - Starburst and hope you aren&#39;t explosive-bolted to \n&gt; death.\n&gt; \n&gt; Skeletons - Barely better than barbarians, since their special lets \n&gt; them dodge. Of course, sometimes they dodge into the line of fire. \n&gt; Also, Turn Undead could be bad.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ghost - Turn Undead could be bad, but all Ghosts can really do is \n&gt; fly around Howling and attacking the enemy. Fear explosive bolts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Faerie - Gets some points since its melee attack is permanent stun \n&gt; against high-level characters. Loses them for having nothing except \n&gt; melee attacks and flight.\n&gt; \n&gt; Slime - If you&#39;re in the line of attack, killing you three times is \n&gt; usually just as easy as killing you once.\n&gt; \n&gt; And there you have it, my opinion on all of the classes of \n&gt; Gladiator. Of course, all of these are biased towards high-level, \n&gt; high-stats duels and towards the other player being skilled at the \n&gt; game.\n\n\nYes, believe it or not, if you try to use Grow Tree on the space \nwhere an enemy is standing then it&#39;s guaranteed death, however much \nI&#39;d prefer insta-death attacks.\n\nIf any class should get InstaDeath attacks, it should be the Faeries -\n they deserve to get more power.\n\n\n"}}
