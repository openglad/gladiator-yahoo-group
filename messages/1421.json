The only thing I know about the next \nseries \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; more of the Orcian Empire. Maybe you can help.\n&gt; \n&gt; One comment: The lowest experience level of my own 100% legitimate \n&gt; team is experience level 94. It has been through all the built-in \n&gt; scenarios, the tevfifty and my own set.  I am concerned about \ncrashing \n&gt; the game because of acquiring too much experience for a single \nplayer.\n&gt; \n&gt; One Question: What scenarios should a player have completed before \n&gt; going into the Unix series into order to avoid problems handling \nthe \n&gt; opponents?\n\nThe levels: Inside Cenwhit Manor, Jarketa&#39;s Gates, Castle Interrior, \nand The Please Register Scen. (Scen0)\n\nAfter second testing which I did today I had probs. with the \nelementals, they always slaughter half of my men. My men were in L. \n50 with 100-120 exp. in everything.\nQuestion: Should the 2nd one be more painful to the player?\n\n\n"}}
