I&#39;d list \narchmages as slightly more powerfull than clerics (I have a scenario \nto prove it), but I&#39;m not sure where to list mages because the ability \nto freeze time (or even slow it down) could lead to just as much \ndamage as summoning fire elementals or raising sketelons/clerics.\n\n&gt; Clerics: Until level 4 they are fine, but at level 4 w/ raise \n skeleton it gets really easy to go up in levels.\n\nI agree.  Once a cleric reaches the point of raising skeletons, \nacquiring experience points for that cleric becomes relatively easy, \nalmost too easy.\n\n&gt;I dont know but it seems like clerics are by far the most powerful of \nthe regular classes. \n\nRespectfully, I disagree.  The current freeze time attack can lead to \nas much ease in winning a scenario as raising skeletons or summoning \nfire elementals.  Right now, I can&#39;t say that any single character is \nthe most powerfull.  Give me a mage with the ability to freeze time \nand I can beat you.  Give me an archmage who can summon fire \nelementals and I can beat you.  Give me a cleric who can raise \nskeletons and ghosts and resurrect and I can beat you.\n\n\n"}}
