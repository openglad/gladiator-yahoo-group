To me, Jakarta was a sub plot.\n\n  Within this, you had several sub-plots: Carl the Druid and \n&gt; the evil magic-users, the undead fighting the slimes, Cenweith \nManor, \n&gt; etc.  Each one of these plots was linear (more or less), so you \nstill \n&gt; got some story told.\n\nActually, I did build up to securing a fairly large area.  Episodes \n3-8 all branch off from scenario #2.  It&#39;s easier to do a linear plot \nand sometimes hard to branch off.  Also, I didn&#39;t list which scenarios \n were connected to other scenarios deliberately.  Names of characters \nget worked on when specifics get worked out.\n \nThe second is that a \n&gt; lot of the levels have premises that may come off strangely: one \n&gt; third of your army has turned -- presumably this doesn&#39;t mean your \n&gt; squad (since you can&#39;t actually steal people from the squad), but if \n&gt; it means simply your NPC forces, then the level will probably wind \nup \n&gt; being pretty easy (2/3 of your forces + you vs. 1/3).\n\nThat is answered easily enough:  Follow the storyline instead of the \nbattles.  Every time you fight in the battlefield, your army equals \nyour hired troops.  Everytime you fight in the storyline, your army \nhas much greater numbers than your hired troops in order to be \nrealistic.\n\n\n"}}
