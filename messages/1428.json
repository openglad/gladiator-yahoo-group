The only thing I know\nabout the next series is more of the Orcian Empire.\nMaybe you can help.&gt;&gt;\n\nUmm... I missed something. Where is this plot coming\nfrom, and what is Unix Series 1?\n\n&lt;&lt;Sorry for posting the hacking thing, but anyone\nstill interested in a Gladiator tournament by now\nisn&#39;t going to cheat ( or at least I don&#39;t think so..?\nmaybe im wrong ) and plus, what is going to be done\nabout Boost? i mean, i guess it is mildly obvious,\nbut.. ok. i&#39;m sorry. do you have adminstrative\nproperties to remove it or something?&gt;&gt;\n\nI have never been able to make Boost work on the\nmodern version of Gladiator. Am I alone in this?\n\n&lt;&lt;In my eternal quest to find out how things work, i\nhave come across a problem... how does Levels.001\nwork? I figure that its a compilation\nof all the .fss files, and Graphics.001 is a\ncompilation of all the .pix files.. but... what?\nOpening it in a hex or text editor gives a bunch of\nvalues.... Anyway, is there anyway to unpack or\nre-pack these files? that would be a superb feature of\na VB level editor.&gt;&gt;\n\n&quot;Gladpack&quot; can make .001 files, and &quot;Unpack&quot; can\nextract stuff from .001 files... I&#39;ve been meaning to\nmake master versions of the Levels.001 and\nGraphics.001 once we&#39;ve worked out what are &quot;accepted&quot;\nfan-made scenarios and what the titles will be.\nUnfortunately, you can&#39;t add to a .001 file, so first\nyou need to unpack all the old stuff and make entirely\nnew Graphics.001 and Levels.001 files, and there are a\nLOT of graphics files that can only be extracted one\nat a time.\n\nA file called &quot;Dayofdra.mod&quot; is mentioned somewhere in\nthe mysterious level 88 (I think that&#39;s the level,\nanyhow, and it doesn&#39;t work on modern Gladiator--it\nreferences graphics that don&#39;t exist), but isn&#39;t in\nthe packed .001 files... any ideas what this is all\nabout?\n\nI apologise for not being very active in the groups\nlately, but I&#39;m no coder... I&#39;d much rather work with\nscenarios using the programs than work on the programs\nusing crazy languages... I hope you understand. I&#39;m\nalso quite busy. But I am still listening, and I hope\nthe TevFifty will stay a part of Gladiator. I am still\nwilling to help with stuff, as long as it&#39;s not time-sensitive...\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSign up for SBC Yahoo!
