I think some \ncharacters need to be more team-oriented than others.  Clerics should \nbe particularly looking to help their team mates.  Also, pushing a \ncleric around just to keep yourself healed doesn&#39;t work too well 100% \nof the time.  I am just about convinced clerics need a radar to \ndetermine their team mates health.  So far, my legit team up to this \npoint is level 8 cleric, level 7 cleric, and 2 level 3 mages.  One of \nmy clerics went from level 4 to level 6 during a scenario after bring \nback lots of skeletons.\n\nHere&#39;s my take on small teams and composition:\n1 character - mage or archmage\n2 characters - 1 cleric and 1 mage or archmage\n3 characters - 2 clerics and 1 mage or archmage\n\nonce you get a level 7 cleric, you don&#39;t elves anymore.  I can&#39;t wait \nto get my registration completed and receive the password.\n\nMy biggest problem is to create a team (without cheating) that can \nhandle any scenario thrown at it, pick up all available gold/silver, \nand be strong enough to handle any large opposition.  To that end, my \nmost versatile team would be 2 or 3 clerics, 2 or 3 druids, 2 or 3 \nelves, and 2 mages.  every member has purpose: clerics - keep \neverybody&#39;s health up and bring in &#39;recruits&#39;; mages - get to areas \nquickly; druids - creates a barrior of trees to block all attacks and \nsummons fairies; and elves - walk through forest to take on foes or \nacquire gold/silver that no one else can reach.\n\nI am looking for a balance between small teams and large teams.  Once \nyou get a cleric to level 4, all you have to do is surive until the \ncleric can create re-enforcements.\n\nOnce I get the registration information back, I will want to create\nmy \nown levels designed to test a team&#39;s versatility.\n\nAbout the RP, I was thinking about a fan-fic.  What I wouldn&#39;t mind\nif \nthe game started off with at least 200-250 scenarios.\n\n\n\n"}}
