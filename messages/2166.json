My ghost keeps getting zapped!\r\nX-Yahoo-Group-Post: member; u=62491402\r\nX-Yahoo-Profile: alternate_dph\r\n\r\n\nI guess it&#39;s because, in my mind, there&#39;s a huge whooping difference\nbetween a skeleton or ghost that&#39;s summoned on the spot and one that&#39;s\neither bought or placed there at the beginning of a scenario.\n\nGenerally, I don&#39;t hire skeletons and/or ghosts, but I decided to do\nso in this case.  I went through the built-in scenarios twice, played\nthrough almost all of Telvido&#39;s 50 in Slaughter,  . . and I&#39;m\nstruggling through my own set.  I keep spending all my money on\nstrength.  I&#39;m afraid of spending much more on constitution or my team\nbecomes even more vulvernable than they already are.\n\nIf it wasn&#39;t for my ghost, though, I couldn&#39;t have gotten my archer\n(or any other character in team for that matter) (why pick him: \nexplosion attack - wipe out lots of faeries at once - and have a\ncharacter who can do a fairly decent job of removing the extra trees)\nthrough Scenario 122 or Yet Even More Hedges without him dying.\n\n[That&#39;s a lesson learned: don&#39;t mix mazes using trees as walls with\neither high powered druids or elves.]\n\n[Gotta move remodeling &quot;Archer Encampment&quot; up in my priority list.] \nThe changes I made to Scenario 121 or Even More Hedges made it a lot\nmore playable. (widening the diagonal rows)\n\nWhat I wouldn&#39;t give for basic intelligence upgrades:\n\n1)instead of a ghost yelling for help, it uses the scare attack and\nheads for the nearest friendly cleric, if there&#39;s one available.\n\n2)a summonded defense command that actually is incredibly strong on\nbehavior so you can force your team to stick together.  Good old\nstrengths in numbers.\n\n3)if you can create an explosion big enough to put a crater on the\nplanet, damn it, you shouldn&#39;t have to run away from the explosion.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
