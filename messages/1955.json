To take care \nof the problem of having so many allies, I had him run as far as he \ncould, then I summoned the computer allies to me, laid a whole lot of \nbombs, released the computers, and ran. Five seconds later, there were \nonly two of us on the team again \n\nHehe.  I have a single slime on my team and I do have to worry about \nit multiplying.  Fortunately, between my barbarian and my archer, I \ncan wipe out excess clones.  I called the slime &quot;revenue&quot; for obvious \nreasons.  The slime still has more health than the rest of time, even \nthough the slime is still experience level 1 while the rest of the \nteam is around experience level 266/267. [I do have a couple of \nconclusions: once you get your team members to the point of being able \nto access all their attacks, you can get a much better return on \ninvestment by spending money on factors other than experience levels. \n There&#39;s more interconnectivity for stats than you realize.]\n\nMy entire team could walk on water without experience any loss in \nhealth due to walking to water.\n\nSo far, I&#39;ve shrank the &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, (#401 in my torture set) \ndown to 83k and map size 58 by 59 in my quest to get things better for \nthat number.  I&#39;m gradually building it down and using the money to \nbuild up the team.\n\n\n"}}
