That\ndidn&#39;t turn out so good for certain tiles.  The tiles on =\r\nthe map are\ndrawn in numerical order, not by name.  A file putting the map =\r\ntiles\nin order is right here:\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?fun=\r\nc=3Ddetail&aid=3D619412&group_id=3D50083&atid=3D500407\n\n\nI could really use=\r\n better gif versions of all the map tiles so if\nsomebody could get around t=\r\no doing that, it&#39;d help a bunch.\n\nI&#39;m also aware the map is fairly small.  =\r\nI&#39;m using the original size\nand scale of all map tiles.  For this applet, w=\r\nould it be much better\nif I doubled the size of all graphics when showing t=\r\nhem on the applet\nor do you guys want me to keep everythign the original si=\r\nze?\n\nAnyways, I&#39;m off to work on reading the maps into the game and\nimpleme=\r\nnting one of my ideas of the map changing as you go.\n\n\n"}}
