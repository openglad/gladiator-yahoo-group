If so, this is your week to discuss those\n&gt; ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll start with a brand one:\n&gt; \n&gt; gargoyle character class\n&gt; basic attack - claw a character in front of it or\n&gt; tail whip a \n&gt; character behind it\n&gt; special attacks\n&gt; 1)glide - this allows the character to glide short\n&gt; distances over \n&gt; trees and water (basic attack won&#39;t work while\n&gt; gliding for obvious \n&gt; reasons)\n&gt; 2)hibernate - this allows the character to turn to\n&gt; stone for healing. \n&gt;  During this process of healing, 95% of the damage\n&gt; from any attack on \n&gt; the character is automatically deflected while mana\n&gt; is used to restore \n&gt; health.  Hibernation ends either after all mana is\n&gt; exhausted or the \n&gt; character is in full health.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s ok to disagree with the moderator.\n&gt; \n\nI like the Gargoyle.\nOK I&#39;ll give it a shot:\n\nClass: Dwarven RockMage\nBasic Attacks: Rocks like the elf.. but better\nSpecial Attacks: 1) Rock Walk- This creates a circle\naround the character of a small radius. Any characters\nin this radius, including the Rockmage himself, may\nwalk through rock for as long as the ability lasts. It\nis intelligence based and works just like Forestwalk\nexcept you carry people with you. The radius increases\nwith intelligence.\n                 2)Rock Melt- destroys a large amount\nof rock walls in a certain radius. radius increases\nwith intelligence. SHIFTER- Rock Barrier- Create a\nsmall rock barrier, radius increases with\nintelligence.\nPermenant effects: N/A\nAttributes: Like the mage. Slower walking because he&#39;s\na dwarf and has shorter legs. Higher armor, health and\nstrength.. almost a battlemage type as dwaves are\nknown for armor constitution and strength.. less\nintelligence as dwarves arent great with magic\nCost: Higher than the mage.\n\nRockWalk may not be that useful.. in which case I\nwould give all dwarven units RockWalk in addition to\ntheir normal stats.. like:\n\n\nClass: Dwarven RockMage\nBasic Attacks: Axe slash ( melee only)\nSpecial Attacks: 1) Axe Fury- An axe slash in a\ncircle.. very powerful\n              \nPermenant effects: RockWalk ( ForestWalk through\nRocks)\nAttributes: Like the soldier. but with much higher\narmor and lower walking speed. dwarves are known for\ntheir armor and their short legs.\nCost: Higher than the soldier because of RockWalk and\narmor\n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
