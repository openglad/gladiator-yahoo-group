I found it wasn&#39;t that\ndifficult to find stuff on it for that compiler(which has a lot in common\nwith Borland except it&#39;s a protected mode thing, anyway. . )  After messing\naround with setting the mode myself and drawing colors to the screen and\nstuff I discovered it is way more convenient to use a game library for your\ngraphics routines rather than write then yourself.  It&#39;s fun to learn how to\ndo it though so I would still encourage it.  Let me see if I can dig up some\nbookmarks for some good pages. . . .Ok found em.  First of all the DJGPP\nsite at http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/  has some links, or used to anyway, to\na couple of basic tutorials on VGA programming.  There are also some good\nsites strictly for game programming. www.jado.org has lots of links to\nsites.  The game programming vault is also a good place to go\nhttp://members.tripod.co.uk/lpfglc/.  The other one I have bookmarked is\nhttp://www.perplexed.com/GPMega/.  I may have more but that&#39;s the only ones\nI could find easily in my bookmarks.  If you need anything else I&#39;d be happy\nto help if I can.  Sorry to everyone else that this isn&#39;t really about\ngladiator,  though I am also curious what it was programmed in. I hope there\nare some other people on this list which the bulk of this message interests.\nAlso I was kinda disappointed about the Alladvantage thing cause I&#39;m sure\nmost people have heard about it already, it&#39;s kinda hard to miss but enough\nof that anyway, I shouldn&#39;t have mentioned it.\n\nSince FSgames is temporarily(we hope) on hold with all the projects I can&#39;t\nhelp but wonder if there is anything we(the gladiator fans) can do to help,\naside from large monetary donations since I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only broke\ncollege student out there.  : )  Ok I&#39;ve said enough,  happy gaming or\ncoding or whatever\n\nBj�rn\n\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Ape &lt;maxim@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@onelist.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, November 06, 1999 8:31 PM\nSubject: [gladiator] Glad\n\n\nFrom: maxim@... (Ape)\n\nI know about the offer from alladvantage, It&#39;s hard to miss the constant\nbarrage of advertisments about it. I&#39;d appreciate not seeing it here. Let\nthis be an end to our disagreement.\n\nAbout Gladiator...\nI was wondering what you guys used to program it, I am learning the basics\nof C and C++ and would like to learn some more about graphical coding. Would\nit be possible to see some of your source code (heh heh...not likely, eh?)\nor at least maybe direct me to somewhere I could learn more...It seems that\nall the graphic resources available online are way too advanced or only for\nspecific compilers such as Microsoft Visual C++ which I don&#39;t have the\npleasure of owning.
