Of course, this means I have\n&gt; to go back and change one of the scenarios to use those.  If anyone\n&gt; wants a sample of my 1st few (I have already sent the 1st four to\n&gt; Tevildo) to check for difficulty, let me know and I will upload them\n&gt; to my website and post the link.  BTW, Tevildo could you send to me\n&gt; your generic PIX file?\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;-Tevildo.&quot; &lt;Tevildo@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Okay, if you&#39;re ready to take the extra step and add Editor.exe\n&gt; into\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; level-making process, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tiles 0-133 can be used; other numbers are available in Editor but\n&gt; if you\n&gt; &gt; use these it will crash Scen.exe or Glad.exe\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tile 8 is the one I mentioned previously, the &quot;permeable wall&quot;\n&gt; which\n&gt; runs\n&gt; &gt; vertical rather than horizontal (Use &#39;em, DPH!)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; tiles 53 and 54 were apparently made funny, so I altered them into\n&gt; usable\n&gt; &gt; column tiles--the Tevildo-altered versions are packed into\n&gt; TevFifty,\n&gt; if you\n&gt; &gt; want to use them\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Editor.exe can also be used to change the dimensions of a map,\n&gt; which\n&gt; I found\n&gt; &gt; VERY useful, as some of my levels are very long one way and very\n&gt; thin the\n&gt; &gt; other way. You can also use it to change all tiles of a particular\n&gt; type into\n&gt; &gt; another type instantly. I suggest that everyone make a palette .PIX\n&gt; file\n&gt; &gt; with samples of all 134 usable tiles, which you can pull up in\n&gt; Scen.exe for\n&gt; &gt; easy access to any map pieces you could ever need. I&#39;d simply send\n&gt; you mine,\n&gt; &gt; but the Mailing List rules say no attachments. Anyway, I hope\n&gt; everyone can\n&gt; &gt; use Editor successfully, as it&#39;s a powerful tool. I may use it to\n&gt; alter the\n&gt; &gt; character images one of these days, but I have other projects to\n&gt; work on\n&gt; &gt; first. Best of luck,\n&gt; &gt;          -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n&gt; &gt;                  (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; ______________________________________________________________________\n&gt; ___\n&gt; &gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at\n&gt; http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Share information about yourself, create your own public profile at\n&gt; &gt; http://profiles.msn.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
