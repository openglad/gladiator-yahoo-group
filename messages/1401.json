That, or\ngladiator@yahoogroups.com deleted the subliminal message i embedded within\nthe thread.\n&gt; PLEASE visit my webpage. PLEASE read gladiator_story.rtf. failure to do so\nwill result in a gang of blood-thirsty orcs coming into your house, howling\nat your dog, and eating the corpses you have stashed in your basement.\n&gt; A big part of writing this is to get positive feedback from other people\nreading it. If i don&#39;t get feedback, i kind of lack the incentive needed to\ncontinue writing. I was hoping for some big appreciation from &#39;Triad&#39; and\nDancing Corpse after finishing chapter 6/7. Also, getting some feedback from\nthe big man upstairs (Tom Ricket of course) would be cool also.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Zjack\n&gt; --\n&gt; __________________________________________________________\n&gt; Sign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\n&gt; http://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\n&gt;\n&gt; Save up to $160 by signing up for NetZero Platinum Internet service.\n&gt; http://www.netzero.net/?refcd=N2P0602NEP8\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
