How odd.\n\nnah, not really. the only scenarios i think were iffy opponent wise \nwere the hedge ones, but that might have just been because it took a \nREAL long time gettin through there (soldiers atw!!). the brag was \nalright except for the doors.. that kinda took away from it. it was \nlike, run across the level, kill 3 guys, get a key, repeat, repeat, \nrepeat. the slimes musta been pretty hi-level too, they were hard to \nkill, as i remember.\n\notherwise, yeah, it&#39;s all good.\n\nOldschool\n\n\n"}}
