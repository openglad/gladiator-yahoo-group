(forgive my reducing everything to base level and explaining\nevery detail, but I have no idea how much you know....) ....if this is the\ncase...make sure you&#39;ve saved yer scenario...it will ask you to name\nit.....I think...(think is the key word) that the level will load first\nrather than the level in the levels.001....but if you havnt renamed the\nlevel AND the grid to scen99 it will only load the one you&#39;ve saved as the\nactual scen99 (naming means pressing &quot;n&quot; then &quot;s&quot; (for scene) and &quot;g&quot; (for\ngrid)...you gotta do both)\nif you know all this and you are mr. Programmer in disguise and know all\nthis stuff already then just ignore me....if not..I hope I have helped....\n-max\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
