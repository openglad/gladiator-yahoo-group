It took \nme a week to read through almost everything and a lot of stuff is \nreally interesting. I havent been posting much since I am waiting for \nthe sourceforge boys to do more characters, spells and maybe \nsomething like LAN play. I keep up though. Just my thoughts.\n\n\n--- In gladiator@y..., &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; If you want, a mailing list could be set up at sourceforge. It&#39;d \n&gt; also benefit from people just finding out about Gladiator and \njoining \n&gt; it (I do have a link to this group from the front page, but not \nmany \n&gt; people go to the front page). An tracker item can also be added \nwhere \n&gt; people would be able to upload maps and stuff, so the files section \n&gt; won&#39;t be lost.\n&gt; \n&gt; One possible solution was setting up a message board to run off the \n&gt; fsgames.com website.  As long the number of messages doesn&#39;t get \nout \n&gt; of hand, that&#39;ll be cheap enough. (The only way the number of \nmessages \n&gt; would get out of hand is if a new version came out, but then \nrevenue \n&gt; would be coming in to pay for it.)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also on the short term, reluctantly I am considering shutting \ndown  \n&gt; public access to message archives to keep spammers from harvesting \n&gt; email addresses from our messages.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to hear some more opinions before shutting off message \n&gt; archives.\n\n\n"}}
