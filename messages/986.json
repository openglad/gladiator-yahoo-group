Give them a wide area, you&#39;ll find\nit hard to walk around in a few minutes.  One thing puzzles me,\nthough.  Why doesn&#39;t bombs from a thief destroy nearby enemy trees?\nPoison clouds have no effect on trees, thus leaving only the basic\nattack to clear your path.\n\nMy only regrets is I wish I had an attack that would just take out\nfaeries, trees, and those damn waves of protection the druid casts.\nHmm.  I might give the druids level 500 potions of invulnverability.\nWait a minute.  that might leave them stuck in a poison cloud.\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
