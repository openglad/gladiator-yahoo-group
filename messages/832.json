I could also use a comma and then\ncheck that the next few characters are a space and then &quot;Reserved:&quot; (this is\nin front of the reserved data in the file), however someone will eventually\nbuild a scenario with that in a characters name just for fun :)\n\nSo what I need is to replace my separator character with something that\nisn&#39;t allowed in Gladiator, or at least not allowed in the names of\ncharacters.\nOnce I solve the problem I can then make sure the code works and the\nconverter is done!\n\nAny suggestions?  Do the other coders have a different method I could use?\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
