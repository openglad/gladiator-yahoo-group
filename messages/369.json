Depending on how much memory \nthe coder \n&gt; wanted to take up with each value, there are a set number of memory \n&gt; locations where the value sits. If it grows larger than the space \nallocated \n&gt; for it, the overflow is discarded.... or if it intrudes on another \nvalue, \n&gt; perhaps one used to run Glad.exe or Windows, you get a nice crash. \nTo make \n&gt; things worse, at one end of your little rented space in memory \nthere&#39;s a bit \n&gt; which tells the computer whether the number is positive or negative. \nIf the \n&gt; value gets too high, it overflows into this area and you usually get \na \n&gt; negative. That&#39;s what I assume happened to our archmages.\n\nI did a trial run with friendly slime help above experience level 250 \nand every time the slime had negative values for both health and magic \nenergy.  Since I have defeated slime with experience level above 1000, \nI know it is possible.\n&gt;      One thing that I&#39;m not quite sure on--which of your levels are \nso \n&gt; difficult? I can beat any of the ones you posted with a character \nbelow \n&gt; level 75. (Of course, the experience gained on the level usually \nputs me \n&gt; above 100.) I think that perhaps you should be steering yourself \naway from \n&gt; the this-is-a-job-for-SuperMage(TM) scenarios and make something \nwith a more \n&gt; universal appeal.\n\nI promise the ones I publish can be defeated with a legitimate team.  \nI am steering myself to slowly increase experience levels of \ncharacters.  Afterall, Extreme Island is about a training ground for \ncharacters.  The planned ending is . . . interesting.  But the pace \nwill be slow.  At tops, I plan on placing maybe 24 experience level \n50s or higher (excluding slime) in future scenarios, but they will be \nthe only high experience level character in that scenario.  Normal \ncharacters will top out with experience levels between 20 and 25 or \nlower.  I have at most 2 or 3 more scenarios with level 10s, then \nabout 10 with level 15s, 10 with level 20s, and 10 more with level \n25s.  I am shifting downward the number of characters in each scenario \ntowards around 50 or so.\n\nIf you want to see my scenarios which have so called gods in them, \nemail me and I will send them to you.  Believe me when I tell you that \nthey make all other of my other scenarios seem like the 1st 2-3 built \ninto the game.  Otherwise, they stay on home computer for my private \ncollection.  I am tempted to email to you, Tevildo, the scenario I \nhave created that gives you 1.6 billion in gold, just so you can get \nsense about what I am talking about when I sa at certain experience \nlevels, you can see the limits of character types.\n\nWhile I am at, let me explain why I have a 1.6 billion dollar \nscenario.  This scenario is for the sole person of allowing me to \ncreate an experience level 100 or higher character to test out in \ncertain situations.  There was just enough money to bring a beginning \narcher to experience level 220.\n&gt;      As for the rocks--I&#39;ve had very large areas filled almost \ncompletely \n&gt; with those rocks that never vanish, and unless you&#39;re a cleric, \nblob, or \n&gt; orc, you can clear them out in a few minutes. Try an archer&#39;s \nbarrage, or \n&gt; just blast away with a mage or archmage. Those rocks will vanish.\n&gt;      I&#39;m still having problems with chain lightning. Used correctly, \nwithout \n&gt; pushing any limits, it still brings my computer to a crawl. It&#39;s a \nnice \n&gt; chance to go get a drink, but it disrupts the role-playing realism. \nA lot. I \n&gt; don&#39;t know how it&#39;s coded, but it may be that there are some \nunnecessary \n&gt; calculations being done, slowing everything up. Or... is there a C \nobject \n&gt; for each little bolt of lightning? Blech. There must be SOME way to \nmake the \n&gt; lightning AI centralised... it&#39;s not my area of expertise so I won&#39;t \ntry to \n&gt; figure it out.\n\nI agree wholeheartedly with you about chain lightning.  Even with a \nmodest (30 characters) amount of opponents, chain lightning can \nseverely cripple the game.  While I am talking about chain lightning, \nI have a complaint against hearburts attacks.  I froze time with a \nmage and used heartburst attack against opponents until I ran out of \nenergy and did not kill any.  However, against the same opponents, my \nmage&#39;s basic attack killed them all with energy to spare.  That is \nsomething I have observed about mages with high experience levels:  \nthe heartburst attack is spread out so much that in small scenarios, \nit affects ALL opponents.\n\nDPH\n\n\n"}}
