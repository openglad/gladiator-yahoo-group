My thinking \nis if th=\r\ne two makes one character instead of two it wouldn&#39;t be such a great \nadvan=\r\ntage ( &#39; That would make characters too powerful&#39; ) that making two \nwould =\r\nbe.  And with that one character you can have the ability to assign \nwhich =\r\nof the two abilities (from one class or the other class) you want to be \nin=\r\n each &#39;slot&#39; of the hybrid character&#39;s abilities ( &#39;half its original \nabil=\r\nites and half the abilities of the other one&#39; ).  Concerning &quot;proposed \nhal=\r\nfing classes&quot; I think it might be a good idea to let any two characters \nco=\r\nmbine.  The only problem with that are graphics (if someone is going to \nma=\r\nke a graphic to show the hybrid as the mixture of the two characters), \nbec=\r\nause if any two characters can combine that would call for 6,227,020,800 \nd=\r\nifferent character graphics to display the different hybrids (unless someon=\r\ne \nwith no life is willing to do all the graphics).  So I don&#39;t know what t=\r\nhe \nanswer to that is, unless you just have one graphic for a hybrid or the=\r\n \nplayer can pick one of the two characters&#39; graphics to be the graphic of =\r\nthe \nhybrid.  I also think that the other idea proposed, &#39;You could NOT pla=\r\nce \nhalfings in a scenario using the editor to fight against&#39;, would create=\r\n a \nhuge disavantage, in my opinion, to the AI controlled characters.  This=\r\n would \nmake the game EVEN MORE easy to destroy your opponents, and isn&#39;t t=\r\nhat what \nwe are all trying to stay away from?\n\nLater,\nTristan\n\n\n[Non-text =\r\nportions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"}}
