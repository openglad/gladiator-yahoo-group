It&#39;d \nalso benefit from people just finding out about Gladiator and joining \nit (I do have a link to this group from the front page, but not many \npeople go to the front page). An tracker item can also be added where \npeople would be able to upload maps and stuff, so the files section \nwon&#39;t be lost.\n\nOne possible solution was setting up a message board to run off the \nfsgames.com website.  As long the number of messages doesn&#39;t get out \nof hand, that&#39;ll be cheap enough. (The only way the number of messages \nwould get out of hand is if a new version came out, but then revenue \nwould be coming in to pay for it.)\n\n&gt; Also on the short term, reluctantly I am considering shutting down  \npublic access to message archives to keep spammers from harvesting \nemail addresses from our messages.\n\nI would like to hear some more opinions before shutting off message \narchives.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
