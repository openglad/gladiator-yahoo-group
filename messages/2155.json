A slightly\namended beginning.\n\nThe idea is 2-3 scenarios where you can hire your entire team and\nstart upgrading your team WITHOUT putting them into harm&#39;s way right\naway.  I haven&#39;t quite finished with the lower part of the fort, though.\n\nThe idea for the lower part is front entrance, then a small area for\narchers to cheat at incoming troops before they enter the main area.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n \nYahoo!
