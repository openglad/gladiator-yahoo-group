Your choice for your GUI.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s what it will do right off the bat:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)copy, decode, and encode grid tile information\n&gt; 2)copoy, decode, and encode scenario file information (all the objects\n&gt; in a map)\n&gt; 3)run the map smoother function over an entire map :)\n&gt; 4)create html maps :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Here&#39;s the stuff that I plan on working on:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)polishing up my map by exception work\n&gt; 2)figuring out what options to give the user for search-and-replace\n&gt; functionality for objects in a map\n&gt; 3)creating thumbnail images using a ported-out version of the radar\n&gt; function\n&gt; 4)*somehow, figure out appropriate conversions so I can have a\n&gt; recaliberation function to make characters in scenarios pretty\n&gt; comparable to the existing player(s) team.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Incidently, I&#39;ve run into a snafu printing out my html maps.  It seems\n&gt; as though I can only print one page width wide and not get the entire\n&gt; map printed out.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yahoo!
