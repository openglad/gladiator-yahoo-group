Is \n&gt;FSGAMES Still running?\n\nAnd dimento wrote:\n\n&gt;Hello,\n&gt;I just started playing Gladiator recently\n&gt;and I must say that it&#39;s a heck of a game. I&#39;ve\n&gt;visited the official page at http://www.fsgames.com\n&gt;and I&#39;ve visited http://plaza.v-wave.com/shayd/\n&gt;It seems that nothing&#39;s happenning any more though...\n&gt;(1) When is Gladiator: Beyond Freedom coming out?\n\nFor the moment, it&#39;s on indefinite hold :( Basically, the overall story \ngoes as such: we (FSGames) originally programmed the Gladiator 3.X series \nas a group of 4 programmers; later on, we got a professional artist to work \nwith us on G:BF and other projects (such as Plux) as well.  However, in the \nlast 18 months, two things happened: (1) most of the group members moved to \ndifferent parts of the country to pursue assorted computer jobs, and (2) \ntwo of our group joined up with Blizzard, and are working full-time on the \n&quot;Diablo 2&quot; project.  Now, don&#39;t get me wrong -- we&#39;re *very* psyched that \nthey&#39;re working on D2 (which looks to be a GREAT game!), but those two \nthings together have meant that our coding on G:BF has dwindled \ndramatically.  And in the computer industry, if you&#39;re not coding on a \nproject full-time, keeping it up-to-date, a project, especially a game, can \nquickly become dated.\n\n&gt;(2) Is there a demo out there for Beyond Freedom?\n\nThere&#39;s supposed to be -- apparently there&#39;s something somewhat screwed up \nwith our web server. I keep meaning to either fix the current link, or put \nup a newer demo... Since I&#39;ve been doing a lot of work with the creator of \nSluggy Freelance lately (which I highly recommend, at http://sluggy.com), I \nkeep forgetting to do that.  I&#39;ll try soon, honest!\n\n&gt;(3) Are there any other sites/links I can visit\n&gt;relating to Gladiator other than the ones mentioned\n&gt;above?\n\nThat I don&#39;t know..\n\n&gt;(4) Is the FSGAMES group still developing games?\n\nRight now, we (a) get together online and play other people&#39;s games, and \n(b) work on games for other companies, ala the D2 stuff I \nmentioned.  Unfortunately, we haven&#39;t been able to keep up FSGames in-house \nprojects recently :(\n\n&gt;Anyways, I&#39;d just like to send out a hello to\n&gt;everyone on this list and compliment the programmers\n&gt;on a game well-made.\n\nMany thanks!\n\nTake care, folks!\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
