I cant really think of GOOD abilities for the Orc Captian \nw/out copying other classes. BUT one really cool &quot;ability&quot; that orc \ncaptians could have (this probably would be hard to code) could be \nRally Troops, where allied troops in the surrounding area would get a \nboost to health, speed, and magic for a short duration (for every \ntime cast.) \n\n\nThieves- This class is really quite ausome and devisating once you \nget high leveled bombs. \n\nWith the addition of doors in many levels I think the theives should \nhave the ability to Pick Locks and pass through doors without having \nto find the keys.\n\n\n"}}
