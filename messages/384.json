I figured i can \nwork on them during school on my laptop while i&#39;m not busy. I&#39;ve been busy \nat home playing EverQuest so it kinda hard for me to focus.  but i have a \nprob determining what difficulty of scenarios i should build.  my last one \nwas kinda bugged and unless someone would like to take a look at the \nscenarios i had for that to maybe fix it they are more then welcome, but my \nmain problem is how hard should i make the new one, i understand you all \nhave incredibly powered groups (well most of you), so how can i make it \ndifficult? i need to know stats on your partys or groups so i can determine \nthe average amonut of difficulty possible.\n\n\n                                                             Thanks for your \nTime,\n                                                               Ricky Der \n(The Legendary Light)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
