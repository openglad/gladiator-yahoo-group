Apparantly,\n&gt; the converter re-aligned teleporters in one of my scenarios [Weakest\n&gt; Link], by changing values out.  Was that problem ever fixed?  When I\n&gt; last saved the file, I had all of my teleporters in a specific\n&gt; alignment, and that&#39;s how I noticed the change?\n\nThe only changes I made in the update were dealing with how the code looks\nand tidyness in output - nothing at all with the actual conversion\nprocess...\n\nIn theory the converter is supposed to leave the objects in the same order\nwhen converting - nothing with sorting has yet been done (busy with uni\nassignments).\nThis means that if you convert the file to text, then back without changing\nit, you should get the original file (with the exception of &#39;garbage\ncharacters&#39; in arrrays).  If the converter is changing values or positions\nof objects it&#39;s not supposed to be doing that - and that is definitely a bug\n:)\n\nCould you describe the problem in a little more detail?  For instance if you\nconvert back and forth without changing the files does it still muck up the\nalignment, and by alignment what do you mean - the order of teleportation,\nwhat it links to, etc.\nIf I can work out what to look for I&#39;ll be able to find the problem :)\n\nCya,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
