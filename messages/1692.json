I \nwould redo my &quot;The Tunneled Labryinth&quot; just to take advantage of that. \n I would also redo &quot;Release of Sun Bai&quot; to put a trigger in it to \neither weaken &quot;Sub Bain&quot; or keep you from freeing him so easily.\n\nHeck, I would put a trigger tied to towers&#39; existance to prevent \ncharacters from using any special attacks or weaken the effectiveness \nof attacks.  In effect, towers were made for triggers.\n\n&gt; Golems are interesting creatures for the game, the problem being \n their size. Almost any level has a spot where a golem could not \nget to.\n\nYea, it&#39;s annoying to design a level for a Golem. My &quot;The Port City&quot; \nuses a Golem, but really can&#39;t defend himself very well. :-(  I would \nlike to give Golems an attack of becoming an ball to run over \nopponents.  Also, Golems should be more resistent to certain attacks \nbecause of their composition.\n \n&gt; Truely I think golems should be summoned as the Master Druid \nspell (level 15 or something). They are too big for regular \nlevels.\n\nor have a Golem generator.\n\nyea, a big request of mine is to add a faerie generator, too.\n\n\n"}}
