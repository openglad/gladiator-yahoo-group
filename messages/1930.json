I personally prefer Python as a\n&gt; scripting language, but then again, a Python\n&gt; interpreter would probably make Openglad a *little*\n&gt; bit bigger than it needs to be. However, I&#39;ll just say\n&gt; this: letting people script their own classes means\n&gt; nothing if they can&#39;t figure out how to do it. But I\n&gt; guess you already knew that, and I&#39;m just trying to\n&gt; show that someone besides DPH cares about Gladiator.\n\nHmm... Well, knowing less about Python than I should for making\nintelligent comments about it, Lua looks to me a bit easier for someone\nto comprehend than Python. If all goes well, an example special in Lua\nwould be something like this:\n\n-- comment describing kill_foe\nfunction kill_foe\n\tmyfoe = get_closest_foe(me);\n\tplay_sound(&quot;superboom.ogg&quot;);\n\tkill(foe);\nend\n\nNow, somewhere there would be a table with the names of the specials,\nalthough we could do something like assume that the function name, with\nall _&#39;s turned to spaces and the first letter of each word capitalized\nis what the person wants as the name.\n\nThe actual class would be a bit harder, probably, but might go something\nlike this:\n\n-- this is a soldier class\nsoldier =\n{\n\t-- initial stats\n\tinit_hp = 90,\n\tinit_mp = 30,\n\tinit_str = 12,\n\tinit_dex = 7,\n\tinit_suchandsuch = blahblahblah,\n\n\t-- stat costs\n\tcost_str = 4,\n\tcost_dex = 7,\n\tcost_suchandsuch = bleh,\n\n\t-- AI settings\n\tescape_special = charge, -- this charge function would be\n\t\t\t\t -- defined in the specials\n\tdeath_special = kill_foe,\n\trun_range = 0,\n\n\t-- specials\n\tspecial =\n\t{\n\t\tcharge,\n\t\tboomerang,\n\t\tblah,\n\t\tbleh\n\t},\n\n\talt_special =\n\t{\n\t\tdisarm\n\t}\n}\n\nSorry if that was long. I&#39;m thinking out loud here. Anyways, that&#39;s the\nbasic idea. It could be prettied up more, but that&#39;s the basic idea. All\nthe curly brackets might scare people off, but if one pads the file with\nenough comments and maybe goes easy on the tabs (lua doesn&#39;t care much\nabout whitespaces), it could be made to look quite inviting. Advanced\ncoders can utilize a lot more of lua, like anonymous functions and all\nthat fun stuff. An excellent (although unfinished) book on Lua is\navailable at http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/luabook1.pdf and takes\nyou through everything you need to know to write cool and complex lua\nprograms.\n\nThe other reason for using Lua is that its really really small,\nrediculously easy to embed, fully extendable with C/C++ functions, and\ncompiles on every platform that has a standards-compliant C or C++\ncompiler. Python might be all that too, though (except small, but that&#39;s\nforgivable).\n\n&gt; Sorry, I&#39;ve no SDL experience. ;-(\n\nIts not too late! Grab a book on SDL and get crackin&#39;! :-)\n\n-- \nZardus &lt;Zardus@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
