[Oh no, we&#39;re all doomed because dph was \n&gt; thinking.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps, archmages should be limited to summoning up to 5 images at \na \n&gt; time and 5 fire elementals at a time.  Once an image is killed, the \n&gt; archmage can summon another one and the same for a fire elemental.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clerics should be limited to having 5 ghosts and 5 skeletons raised \n&gt; from the dead at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Druids would be limited to summoning 5 faeries at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this would make it harder for those characters to gain \n&gt; mega-experience in just a few scenarios.\n\nHey Daniel nice idea if only Tom would pick up on it...\nThis is true because my friend and I played 2 clerics once and the \nbiggest challenge was seeing who could get to the closest blood-spot \nfirst :).\n\nKeep bringing up the great ideas and hope that you don&#39;t rip a rip in \nthe time-space continum.\n\n\n"}}
