If so, this is your week to discuss those ideas.\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;ll start with a brand one:\n&gt;\n&gt;   gargoyle character class\n&gt;   basic attack - claw a character in front of it or tail whip a\n&gt;   character behind it\n&gt;   special attacks\n&gt;   1)glide - this allows the character to glide short distances over\n&gt;   trees and water (basic attack won&#39;t work while gliding for obvious\n&gt;   reasons)\n&gt;   2)hibernate - this allows the character to turn to stone for healing.\n&gt;   During this process of healing, 95% of the damage from any attack on\n&gt;   the character is automatically deflected while mana is used to restore\n&gt;   health.  Hibernation ends either after all mana is exhausted or the\n&gt;   character is in full health.\n&gt;\n&gt;   It&#39;s ok to disagree with the moderator.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;         Yahoo!
