Philips\nDeathifier\n\nAnd Tom Ricket has offered to provide us with some code snippits if we need\nthem.\n\nCritics:\nDaniel Paul Hightower\nRicky Der\n\nContributors to feature list:\ndancing corpse\nDaniel Paul Hightower\nGeorge &quot;Cookie&quot; Philips\nAnyone else I missed, some ideas contributed by multiple people.\n\nMain features:\n-Make it mouse driven, with shortcut keys to regularly used options - have\nan interface similar to the current editors.\n\n- Auto scenario number changing/renumbering (Not hard really, change\nfilenames, change links on teleporters, reasonably straightforward).\n\n- Enable copying and pasting of objects and items on the grid.\n\n- Provide various brush sizes, like 1x1, 3x3 and 5x5, for faster terrain\nmodification.\n\n- Allow resizing of map size.\n\n- Include undo and redo options (how many levels?).\n\n- Need complete and thorough documentation, including a list of features,\nhow to use them, and some tutorials.\n\n- Provide the ability to modify stats for NPC&#39;s directly.\n\n- Combines all or most of the features from scen.exe and editor.exe\n\n\n\nSpecificatoins (Thanks to Tom Ricket, and George &quot;Cookie&quot; Philips):\n &gt;    // Format of a scenario object list file version\n &gt; 6/7+ is:\n &gt;    // 3-byte header: &#39;FSS&#39;\n &gt;    // 1-byte version #\n &gt;    // 8-byte string = grid name to load\n &gt;    // 30-byte scenario title (ver 6+)\n &gt;    // 1-byte char = scenario type, default is 0\n &gt;    // 2-bytes par-value, v.8+\n &gt;    // 2-bytes (short) = total objects to follow\n &gt;    // List of n objects, each of 7-bytes of form:\n &gt;           // 1-byte ORDER\n &gt;           // 1-byte FAMILY\n &gt;           // 2-byte short xpos\n &gt;           // 2-byte short ypos\n &gt;           // 1-byte TEAM\n &gt;           // 1-byte facing\n &gt;           // 1-byte command\n &gt;           // 1-byte level // 2 bytes in version 7+\n &gt;           // 12-bytes name\n &gt;           // ---\n &gt;           // 10 bytes reserved\n &gt;    // 1-byte # of lines of text to load\n &gt;    // List of n lines of text, each of form:\n &gt;           // 1-byte character width of line\n &gt;           // m bytes == characters on this line\n\n\nSpecs Clarification:\n &gt; &gt;    // 8-byte string = grid name to load\n &gt;This apparently has something to do with the internal name of the file;\n &gt;&quot;SCEN0000&quot;, &quot;SCEN0030&quot;, etc..\n &gt;\n &gt;It doesn&#39;t seem to be *that* important, and could probably default to the\n &gt;filename (assuming it&#39;s 8.3)\n\nBasically, that&#39;s so that (technically) multiple scenario files can all use\nthe same background grid file.  For example, scen1.fss, scen2.fss, and\nscen3.fss could all use a background grid file called &quot;forest99&quot; if you\nwanted them to.\n\nIt&#39;s not a feature we ended up making much use of, though.\n\n &gt; &gt;    // 30-byte scenario title (ver 6+)\n &gt;\n &gt;Standard C String -- null terminated, then padded with garbage to get to\n &gt;the 30th byte.\n &gt;\n &gt; &gt;    // 1-byte char = scenario type, default is 0\n &gt;\n &gt;I guess non-0 is for deathmatch. I&#39;m not gonna bother looking (mainly\n &gt;&#39;cause I dunno where the DM levels are stored. ;))\n &gt;\n &gt;Actually, when I converted scen1.fss to v8, it came up with a &#39;1&#39; rather\n &gt;than a &#39;0&#39;. Odd.\n &gt;\n &gt; &gt;    // 2-bytes par-value, v.8+\n &gt;\n &gt;How fast you&#39;re supposed to complete the level, in hex, it seems.\n &gt;Unsigned, too.\n &gt;\n &gt; &gt;    // 2-bytes (short) = total objects to follow\n &gt;\n &gt;unsigned, or signed? I doubt anyone&#39;s map would even begin to approach\n &gt;THAT many objects... but nonetheless it&#39;s a possibility.\n &gt;\n &gt; &gt;    // List of n objects, each of 7-bytes of form:\n &gt; &gt;           // 1-byte ORDER\n &gt; &gt;           // 1-byte FAMILY\n &gt;\n &gt;ORDER of 0 seems to be a character (either friend or foe):\n &gt;because ORDER 0x00 FAMILY 0x00 is a warrior.. and ORDER 0x00 FAMILY 0x02\n &gt;is an archer..\n\nHere, I can get a list of those ... this is kind of long, though!\n\nFirst, here are the ORDER values:\n\n// Orders\n#define ORDER_LIVING 0\n#define ORDER_WEAPON 1\n#define ORDER_TREASURE 2\n#define ORDER_GENERATOR 3\n#define ORDER_FX 4\n#define ORDER_SPECIAL 5\n#define ORDER_BUTTON1 6\n\n... and here are the various FAMILY values (there&#39;s one set for each order):\n\n// Living familes\n#define FAMILY_SOLDIER 0\n#define FAMILY_ELF 1\n#define FAMILY_ARCHER 2\n#define FAMILY_MAGE 3\n#define FAMILY_SKELETON 4\n#define FAMILY_CLERIC 5\n#define FAMILY_FIREELEMENTAL 6\n#define FAMILY_FAERIE 7\n#define FAMILY_SLIME 8\n#define FAMILY_SMALL_SLIME 9\n#define FAMILY_MEDIUM_SLIME 10\n#define FAMILY_THIEF 11\n#define FAMILY_GHOST 12\n#define FAMILY_DRUID 13\n#define FAMILY_ORC   14\n#define FAMILY_BIG_ORC 15\n#define FAMILY_BARBARIAN 16\n#define FAMILY_ARCHMAGE 17\n#define FAMILY_GOLEM 18\n#define FAMILY_GIANT_SKELETON 19\n#define FAMILY_TOWER1 20\n\n//Weapon families\n#define FAMILY_KNIFE 0\n#define FAMILY_ROCK 1\n#define FAMILY_ARROW 2\n#define FAMILY_FIREBALL 3\n#define FAMILY_TREE 4\n#define FAMILY_METEOR 5\n#define FAMILY_SPRINKLE 6\n#define FAMILY_BONE 7\n#define FAMILY_BLOOD 8\n#define FAMILY_BLOB 9\n#define FAMILY_FIRE_ARROW 10\n#define FAMILY_LIGHTNING 11\n#define FAMILY_GLOW 12\n#define FAMILY_WAVE 13\n#define FAMILY_WAVE2 14\n#define FAMILY_WAVE3 15\n#define FAMILY_CIRCLE_PROTECTION 16\n#define FAMILY_HAMMER 17\n#define FAMILY_DOOR 18\n#define FAMILY_BOULDER 19\n\n// Treasure families\n#define FAMILY_STAIN 0\n#define FAMILY_DRUMSTICK 1\n#define FAMILY_GOLD_BAR 2\n#define FAMILY_SILVER_BAR 3\n#define FAMILY_MAGIC_POTION 4\n#define FAMILY_INVIS_POTION 5\n#define FAMILY_INVULNERABLE_POTION 6\n#define FAMILY_FLIGHT_POTION 7\n#define FAMILY_EXIT 8\n#define FAMILY_TELEPORTER 9\n#define FAMILY_LIFE_GEM 10 // generated upon death\n#define FAMILY_KEY 11\n#define FAMILY_SPEED_POTION 12\n\n// Generator families\n#define FAMILY_TENT 0  // skeletons\n#define FAMILY_TOWER 1 // mages\n#define FAMILY_BONES 2 // ghosts\n#define FAMILY_TREEHOUSE 3 // elves :)\n\n// FX families\n#define FAMILY_STAIN 0\n#define FAMILY_EXPAND 0\n#define FAMILY_GHOST_SCARE 1\n#define FAMILY_BOMB 2\n#define FAMILY_EXPLOSION 3      // Bombs, etc.\n#define FAMILY_FLASH 4          // Used for teleporter effects\n#define FAMILY_MAGIC_SHIELD 5   // revolving protective shield\n#define FAMILY_KNIFE_BACK  6    // Returning blade\n#define FAMILY_BOOMERANG  7     // Circling boomerang\n#define FAMILY_CLOUD 8          // purple poison cloud\n#define FAMILY_MARKER 9         // Marker for Mages Teleport\n#define FAMILY_CHAIN 10         // &#39;Chain lightning&#39; effect\n#define FAMILY_DOOR_OPEN 11     // The open door\n\n &gt; &gt;           // 2-byte short xpos\n &gt; &gt;           // 2-byte short ypos\n &gt;You said you could make new map-sizes by making blank .pix files and\n &gt;converting them to maps?
