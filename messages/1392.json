Allrighty, we&#39;ll keep all that in \nmind while planning our course of action from here on. I think we&#39;ll \nget the whole thing compiling first (maybe after replacing the \nassembly), then go from there.\n\nAs long as your group works within goals and manageable steps, there \nwon&#39;t be problems.  That&#39;s the big thing about my to-do-list.  It \nbreaks things down into steps, with each step being not too big or too \nlittle.\n\nI am planning on working my way towards having a discussion about new \nspecifications for the scenario files so that&#39;s why bringing every \nscenario up to version 3.8 is in the list of things to do in the 1st \nphase.\n\nIf you guys ever run out of ideas of what to do with the game, I&#39;m \nsure that we can come up with more.\n\n\n"}}
