If you look\ncloser you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s actually part of the text that was inside the\ntext file which was used to produce the scenario file :)\n\nAs far as I can tell this has no effect on the data in the scenario, the\nability to convert the scenario (either way) or when playing the game with a\nscenario produced by it.\n\nI will correct the bug on my drive, but I won&#39;t upload it to my website yet.\nI will put the corrected version into the yahoo group area or whatever once\nit&#39;s ready.\n\nHave fun!\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
