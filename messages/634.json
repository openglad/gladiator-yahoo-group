It seems as\n&gt;though the characters keep attacking the doors until they open.  The\n&gt;two reasons I used doors in &#39;The Brag&#39; was to control how many\n&gt;opponents you dealt with at a time and to slow the player down.\n\ncan&#39;t you just fix this problem by putting 4-5 doors on each square?\n\n\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
