I know people can do some pretty \nneat stuff with programs, so why not this? It would make a tournament a lot \nearier to run, and I think head-to-head combat is far more entrtaining then \nbeating on a few computers.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
