I&#39;ve written\n&gt; out a basic outline of how the rules would work\n&gt; on my own, and would be happy to organize it, but\n&gt; I need to know if anyone would participate.\n\nThe only problem is that multiplayer Gladiator still is not possible \nunless it is on the same computer.  This means that only singler-\nplayer touraments are possible.  The problem with that is that \npeople can cheat in single player mode.  \n--\nSgMitchell\nsmitchell@...\n\n\n\n"}}
