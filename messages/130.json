I used to have it but since\nI had to format my hard drive, I lost it and was unable to get it back\nbecause the link on the site doesn&#39;t seem to work.  If you do, speak up\nand maybe you can send it over to me, I could mirror it on my FTP for the\nFSGames site (I run off a cable modem).  Also, if you&#39;ve got it and don&#39;t\nwant to spend the time looking me up, upload it to a xoom account or\nsomething and post the address to this list.  Someone has *got* to have\nit.  Anyone? :)  (ICQ#: 18074806)\n\nThanks guys, enjoy your weekend.\n     -Chris\n\n\n\n"}}
