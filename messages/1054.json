It \nhas 8000 objects in it.  It still wasn&#39;t through.  It took about 5 \nminutes for the program to process scenario 131 of my set and it has \nonly 412 objects.  I am going to have to speed up the code, or put a \nwarning out there.\n\nlet me see 400 * 20 = 8000, and 5 * 20 = 100.  Hmm.  It might take \naround 100 minutes to put that scenario in text.  That&#39;s almost 2 \nhours and unacceptable.  I definitely am going to try to speed up that \ncode somehow.\n\n\n"}}
