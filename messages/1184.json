I even had elves in a forest who\ncouldn&#39;t use up their magical energy unless time was frozen.  My\nanswer is tying the amount of magical energy used for an attack to the\ntotal amount of magical energy available.\n\nSoldier definitely fits this criteria of imperfection, but I am\npicking on it for another reason: given the exact same amount of\nmagical energy, a thief can do more damage than a solder.  That&#39;s\nright, a solder is magic guzzler.  My answer to this dilemna is\nincrease the amount of damage done per attack by a soldier.\n\nA standard level 30 computer generated elf can walk through a forest\nwithout losing magical energy unless it engages in an attack.  Even\nthen, once the attack is completed, it can recharge while in the\nforest.  Big deal, right?  wrong.  Think about it.  (I am going to\nwait 3-4 days before I expose the potential problem this creates to\nsee if anyone else figures it out.)\n\nAny more reviews of either the elf or the solder are welcome right\nnow.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSend and receive Hotmail on your mobile device: http://mobile.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
