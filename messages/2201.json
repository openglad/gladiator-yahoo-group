Right now, he is between semesters and is trying to\nfinish cleaning his house up.  When he gets through that project, he\nplans on keeping some promises made to a college professor regarding\noverdue programming assignments as well as revise the code for Jesse,\nmainly create an assistant program for Jesse and change out code to\neliminate the need for calling several functions as well as make the\nprogram more flexible for changes in the source code for gladiator. \nOnce those new changes are implemented in Jesse, specs will change. \nFor once, Jesse will actually require at least 1 data file be\ninstalled in the same folder as the rest of the program.  To do the\nstuff he really wants to do, you&#39;ll also have to have a copy of the\ngraphic files for gladiator installed in the same folder as Jesse, at\nleast for this version.\n\n;)\n\n\n\n"}}
