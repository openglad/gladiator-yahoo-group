I just Joined to this list. I love gladiator.  I have been using the \n&gt;editor recently and I have built some challenging stages.  If you would \n&gt;like a copy.  E-mail me.  My favorite character is the Cleric.  I can&#39;t \n&gt;wait until the new Gladiator-Beyond Freedom comes out.  Well. See you \n&gt;all.  Write Back\n\nHi there!  Glad to see you on the list, and thanks for letting us know \nabout the stages! Right now, one of the other Gladiator fans is trying to \nput together a page that will hold a list of many user-created levels, also!\n\n&gt;From: AmyVan133@...\n&gt;\n&gt;Hello! It&#39;s great to finally here from somone who sounds as excited about\n&gt;gladiator as me. How long have you been playing it? Me, about 6mths or so. It\n&gt;is really a awesome game! Have you ever played gauntlet? I just started\n&gt;playing that on the playstation version. I would love to hear more about your\n&gt;new stages! bye!\n\nI&#39;ve probably mentioned this before, but we (the Gladiator team) definitely \nlike Gauntlet -- the original version (way back in 1984, or so) helped give \nus ideas about how we wanted Gladiator to be!\n\nSee ya, guys!\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
