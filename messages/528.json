By requiring posting your team stats every 5 scenarios or so, I \nam hoping that the honor system will work and it will also encourage \ncompetition.\n\nAs far as working on new scenarios, I am skipping ahead to work on a \nscenario very similiar to &#39;Weakest Link&#39; because I have finished work \non it.  The teleporters are all lined up, kaing use of teleporters \nmuch easier, and I am able to beat this scenario at Slaughter with my \nmega Archmage without summoning images or fire elementals.  One man \nteams can beat this scenario if you apply a good strategy.\n\n\n"}}
