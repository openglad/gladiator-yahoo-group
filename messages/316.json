Yep, all fire elementals created by that \narchmage are indestructible and have unlimited magic power.  \n\nSo much for the theory that a legitimate team will NEVER get to \ncertain power levels.  There is only question left:  at what limits do \ncharacter&#39;s attacks start crossing over from positive values into \nnegative values?\n\nFurthermore, new parameters may have to be set for how easy hard \nlevels are.  I mean right now, I am pretty sure that any member of my \n100% legitimate team can take out any experience level 1 of anything \nfairly easily, with the exception of a certain level containing &#39;10 \nincompetent mages&#39; in the tevfifty.  I still can not figure out that \ntrick for making them invulvernable at the start, even after looking \nat the scenario in the editor.\n\nAlso, I certainly realize that, although reaching the limits \nestablished may seem impossible now, if someone else takes off where I \nplan on leaving by creating scenarios that make teams even stronger, \nthere may be a future problems developing as characters reach \nimpotence.  I am serious.  If every member of my 100% legitimate team \nreaches [let us say experience] level 30, for my team to have a \nchallenge it must take on only opponents of level 30 or higher.  but \nsomeone else&#39;s legitimate has not been through as many scenarios and \ncan not take on the scenarios my team can and that person will be \nfrustrated because it is seemingly impossible for his legitimate teams \n to bet those scenarios right away.  \n\nSomeone else besides me needs to chime on this argument about \npowerfull teams should end up.   My 2 clerics on my team have both \nexperience levels above 40.  My mage has experience level of 19.\n\n\n"}}
