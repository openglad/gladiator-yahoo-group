I think some\n&gt; characters need to be more team-oriented than others.  Clerics should\n&gt; be particularly looking to help their team mates.  Also, pushing a\n&gt; cleric around just to keep yourself healed doesn&#39;t work too well 100%\n&gt; of the time.  I am just about convinced clerics need a radar to\n&gt; determine their team mates health.  So far, my legit team up to this\n&gt; point is level 8 cleric, level 7 cleric, and 2 level 3 mages.  One of\n&gt; my clerics went from level 4 to level 6 during a scenario after bring\n&gt; back lots of skeletons.\n&gt;\n&gt; Here&#39;s my take on small teams and composition:\n&gt; 1 character - mage or archmage\n&gt; 2 characters - 1 cleric and 1 mage or archmage\n&gt; 3 characters - 2 clerics and 1 mage or archmage\n&gt;\n&gt; once you get a level 7 cleric, you don&#39;t elves anymore.  I can&#39;t wait\n&gt; to get my registration completed and receive the password.\n&gt;\n&gt; My biggest problem is to create a team (without cheating) that can\n&gt; handle any scenario thrown at it, pick up all available gold/silver,\n&gt; and be strong enough to handle any large opposition.  To that end, my\n&gt; most versatile team would be 2 or 3 clerics, 2 or 3 druids, 2 or 3\n&gt; elves, and 2 mages.  every member has purpose: clerics - keep\n&gt; everybody&#39;s health up and bring in &#39;recruits&#39;; mages - get to areas\n&gt; quickly; druids - creates a barrior of trees to block all attacks and\n&gt; summons fairies; and elves - walk through forest to take on foes or\n&gt; acquire gold/silver that no one else can reach.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am looking for a balance between small teams and large teams.  Once\n&gt; you get a cleric to level 4, all you have to do is surive until the\n&gt; cleric can create re-enforcements.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once I get the registration information back, I will want to create\n&gt; my\n&gt; own levels designed to test a team&#39;s versatility.\n&gt;\n&gt; About the RP, I was thinking about a fan-fic.  What I wouldn&#39;t mind\n&gt; if\n&gt; the game started off with at least 200-250 scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; 0% Introductory APR!\n&gt; Instant Approval!\n&gt; Aria Visa - get yours today.\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/6035/9/_/490105/_/962807662/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
