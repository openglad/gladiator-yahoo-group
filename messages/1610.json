This new version\nis a bugfix release, so anyone who had been having trouble with Openglad\nshould upgrade to this.\n\nThe list of changes for this version is:\n\n  - The plugging of an extremely nasty memory leak (that could leak a meg\n    every few minutes) in the foe finding code. As far as I can tell, that\n    leak has been in the code ever since the foe finding code was written,\n    which would make this a pretty dang long-lived memory leak. Other\n    sizable leaks were plugged too, but I forgot the details on those.\n  - For those who had trouble with fullscreen in Windows, it should\n    hopefully work now. For once, the windows binaries were released at\n    the same time as the Linux ones, so you can go ahead and try it out\n    whenever you want. There is still no working joystick support for\n    Windows, and as soon as I can get USB configured in my Windows\n    emulator prog, I&#39;ll get to working on that.\n  - A long list of crashes was fixed, too long to remember :-)\n  - File finding code was improved. It properly checks the current\n    directory now.\n  - All the required files are now included in the distribution (this\n    should fix the missing DLL errors some windows users were having).\n    The docs are also in there.\n\nThe new release can be downloaded from http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net,\nor through the project site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm).\nThis time, the source comes in both tar.gz and zip format, so Windows\nusers can use the .zip without making WinZip choke on the tar.gz format.\nThere is a makefile for VC in case anyone wants to work on the source code\na bit. Openglad can be compiled by executing &quot;nmake /f Makefile.vc&quot; in the\nsrc/ directory.\n\nIt is very well possible that the fixes messed up working stuff, so if\nanyone finds any bugs whatsoever (there are no known ones at the time of\nthis writing), please submit a bug report (at\nhttps://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=50083&atid=458515).\n\nThat&#39;s that for Openglad 0.97. Most of the changes I noted above were done\nin the last 4 days or so. Over the last few months, me and Sean have been\nworking on Openglad Enhanced. We&#39;re currently working on cleaning up the\ncode to make the whole thing easier to work with, and as soon as school\nlays off a bit, we&#39;ll be able to go at a much quickker pace, so hopefully\nthere will be great things for Openglad in the future.\n\n\nThat&#39;s it for now. Enjoy the new release!\n\n- Yan\n\n\n"}}
