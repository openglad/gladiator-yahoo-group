It is not like there is nothing\n&gt; to talk about.  I can think of quite a few questions to be or have\n&gt; been posed that almost everyone should have a comment about.\nMost of the subscribers might not have anything to talk about, or they may\nno longer be interested in the game, I for one barely play it anymore as\nmany other games have come along since I purchased gladiator.\nThe people that post are the &#39;core&#39; or devoted ones, the others on the list\nhave varying degrees of interest, every now and then they might post\nsomething.\nI think many are waiting for &quot;Gladiator 2&quot; or Gladiator: Beyond Freedom or\nsome sort of sequel, thats one of the reasons I&#39;m still here :)\n\n&gt; Examples:\n&gt; What kind of scenario that is not out there would you like to see?\n&gt; Which gladiator character is the best?  why?\n&gt; What team is the best for handling any kind of scenario?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have general question:  when you finish all the scenarios that are\n&gt; shipped with the registered version of gladiator, what is the\n&gt; *lowest*\n&gt;  experience level that any member of your team has?  I need to know\n&gt; because of plans for the scenarios I am working on.\nI tend to just play with a single cleric, but I completely forget which\nlevel it ends up at once I finish all the built-in scenarios, it&#39;s been a\nvery long time since I last played through it.\n\nCya,\nDeathifier\n- Throwing in his somewhat confusing opinions.\n\n\n"}}
