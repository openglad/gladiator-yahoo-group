One thing: I\ndon&#39;t think more than 5 scenarios should be\nNPC-protecting levels. Frankly, they&#39;re a pain in the\nass, and it&#39;s extraordinarily frustrating to play them\non Slaughter. It&#39;s not thematic, either... a party of\nrefugees traveling through hostile territory would\nhave to expect to take heavy losses. And if you&#39;re\nwith them, then how would it make sense for the death\nof your fighters to be okay while the death of a\nsingle non-combatant was unacceptable? Screwy. Anyway,\nwe&#39;ll need to agree on a few things: difficulty, of\ncourse. Will this be a &quot;from scratch&quot; thing, as in\nsomething you start with a brand-new team? How large\nshould the maps be? My preference, of course, is for\nreally large maps, but not everyone will want to spend\ntheir time creating non-necessary space. Comments?\n\nMy version of Gladiator is becoming increasingly\nunstable. These days I can usually only play a stage\nor two and then it crashes. I assume this is because\nof all the .fss and .pix files in my Glad directory...\nthe program has to load all of them. I&#39;m thinking that\nperhaps, once I&#39;m absolutely sure I like the way the\nTevFifty are, and everyone else puts out a finished\nversion of their levels, I&#39;ll pull all the files out\nof the included .001 files and re-pack it all, with\nthe new stuff. Just a thought.\n    -T.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nSend your FREE holiday greetings online!\nhttp://greetings.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
