Press \nControl D to do that.\n \n&gt; 2) I heard mention of levels where NPCs couldn&#39;t die -- that is, you \n&gt; cannot let team 0 people die and still win.  How exactly does this \n&gt; work?\n\nPress &quot;*&quot; while editing the scenario with built-in scenario editor.  \nYou&#39;ll have a couple of other options to choose from.\n\nHonestly, I would rather people work on the &quot;50 Project&quot; than start \non a brand new set on their own.  I almost have the entire storyline \nready (I plan on finishing within an hour.).\n\n\n"}}
