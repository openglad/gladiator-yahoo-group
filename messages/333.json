Tevildo, if and when you get around to testing mine, \n just download off my website because they are still under \nconstruction (I have not been play-tested them with a legitimate \nteam).  I prefer to do playtesting with a legitimate through the \nseries, as opposed to one at a time.  This series is going to be at \nleast 13 scenarios and I have only created 4 of them so far (just \ncreated #4, after being somewhat satisfied with other 3).  That brings \nmy total to 11.\n\n\nI noticed teleporters will not ordinarily let a character teleport \ninto water (except for ghosts or faeries) or into trees (except for \nghosts, faeries, and elves) [no comment why I noticed it].  Can you \nplease remove this limitation [I am probably the only one who thinks \nof it is a limitation] from Gladiator:Beyond Freedom?\n\n\nMay I make a real simple suggestion?  When you get around to working \non Gladiator:Beyond Freedom, pay people $10 to develop a good scenario \nto give the game lots of initial scenarios.\n\n\n"}}
