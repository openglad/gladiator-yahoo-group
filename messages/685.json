Chain-lightning shouldn&#39;t pass\n&gt; through a character unless the character dies because of\n&gt; chain-lightning.\n\nThats more of a design issue, although it&#39;s generally done that it jumps\nregardless.\nSomething to think about for Beyond Freedom.\n\n&gt; I wonder how much time could be saved if you could\n&gt; turn off the chain-lightning graphic traveling from one character to\n&gt; another.\n\nNot sure, the calcuation cruncher is in the chain lightning routine, drawing\nit is likely to just go through a list of objects to draw and say &quot;Are you\nvisible, do I need to draw you?&quot; and so they&#39;d still be checked.\n\n&gt; Another possibility is limit chain-lightning in such a way\n&gt; that one chain-lightning go after a single character at a time.  If 5\n&gt; chain-lightnings are going after a single character, combine them.\n\nAnother design issue, but then if you have them comming from different\ndirections it&#39;d be a little unrealistic, and if you combine the effects then\nthe characters movement would get out of sync so you&#39;d have an odd loooking\nsituation :)\n\n&gt; I just tried running chain lightning at speed setting 2, and well, it\n&gt; doesn&#39;t matter.  Handling 60 slime with chain-lightning seem to\n&gt; seriously slow it down.\n\nI should probably see what it actually does :)\nThe speed setting shouldn&#39;t matter, the calculations are still done, they\nwould be just done a little further apart and the small delay wouldn&#39;t be\nnoticible.\n\n&gt; I think it might be faster to go through the entire area effected\n&gt; (spelling?)looking for characters as opposed to looking at every\n&gt; character and checking coordinates.  Of course that might be\n&gt; impossible if the coding wasn&#39;t written for that.\n\nYeah this depends on the code structure and data structures they use -\ncharacters are most likely stored as an object (or structure) and stuck in a\nlist of some sort.  Said list is then travesed every time they want to check\non something regarding all characters.\nIt&#39;s not the most efficient, but it is the easiest way to do it :)\nI don&#39;t know what they use in more recent games though, Baldurs Gate could\nget away with it simply because you only have a small number of characters\nin an area at once, not sure about RTS games (which can have bucket loads of\nunits), eventually I&#39;ll find out :)\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
