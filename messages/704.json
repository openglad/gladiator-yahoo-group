Sometimes\n&gt; I&#39;ll have other programs running in the background and I can chain fifty\n&gt; guys with no problem; sometimes I run it totally by itself from DOS and it\n&gt; takes half an hour for the lightning to cycle through fifteen guys. I\ndon&#39;t\n&gt; have the fastest computer, but it shouldn&#39;t be crippled by something like\n&gt; that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Something I&#39;ve noticed: one of the only other things that will slow down\n&gt; Gladiator is having a whole hell of a lot of elemental fire on the screen.\n&gt; But that&#39;s ONLY if the fire is on the screen where you can see it. Once\nyou\n&gt; stop sunbursting and the flames reach the edge of the visible field\n&gt; everything speeds up again. Usually this lag isn&#39;t significant, but it&#39;s\n&gt; noticeable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Half-classes made by merging two preexisting characters? How do you\npropose\n&gt; to make that thematic? &quot;The orc tears viciously into the druid, devouring\n&gt; his flesh and gaining his skills!&quot; or &quot;After undergoing horrific\noperations,\n&gt; the Archer finally healed... his old skeleton entirely removed and\nreplaced\n&gt; with the reanimated skeleton of a dead man.&quot; or &quot;The thief successfully\n&gt; stole the archmage&#39;s staff and cloak.&quot; I don&#39;t see how this could\nreasonably\n&gt; be introduced, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.\n&gt;      -T.\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
