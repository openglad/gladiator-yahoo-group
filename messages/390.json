There has been a lull of silence on this list, and I \nfigured it was due to a real lack of development on the Gladiator \nfront.\n\nThis isn&#39;t directly about Gladiator, but about a game that is similar \nto it.\n\nAre any of you familiar with MUDs?  For those of you who aren&#39;t, a \nMUD is basically a game that you connect to with a 100% text \ninterface and explore and communicate with other players by typing in \ncommands.\n\nGiven that description, many of you can see how casual and how stern \na MUD can be about its &#39;roleplaying&#39; -- roleplaying is how you play \nyour character.  If you play your character like you&#39;re talking to \nyour pals on ICQ, then you are not roleplaying.  But if you play your \ncharacter like he is really facing off with that enormous dragon in a \nfight to the death, then you are roleplaying.  Roleplaying is \nespecially entertaining when there are other players roleplaying with \nyou as well, a real drug for the active imagination (which I&#39;m sure \nmany of us bear).\n\nI&#39;ve found a MUD that, while based on a desolate planet called \nZalanthas, has classes and a history similar to that which your \nGladiator characters might have.  Some of the beginning classes \ninclude: warrior, ranger, assassin, burglar, pickpocket, and \nmerchant; with subclasses (things that your characters is good at \nsecond) archer, forester, hunter, physician, house servent, thief, \nweaponscrafter, and even bard.  Reading those probably sparks a few \nideas about Gladiator characters you&#39;ve played.\n\nThe roleplaying standards here are the strictest of any MUD I&#39;ve \nseen.  The administrators will intervene if someone around you isn&#39;t \nplaying their character realistically, and this sort of regulation \nmakes playing a hell of a lot of fun.  You really feel like you&#39;re on \na desolate desert planet, striving to acquire resources so you can \nsurvive another day or two.  Because of the inherent power of the \nmagic classes, you have to play one &quot;regular&quot; character fairly well \nbefore you apply for a &#39;magicker.&#39;  Every character has a rich \nbackground and a minimum four-line description which you have to \nsubmit before you start playing and has to be approved by the \nadministrators (which usually happens in under 24 hours).\n\nA rich background, intelligent players, and unique races and classes \nall conform to bring forth the best roleplaying environment I&#39;ve ever \nplayed (sounds like an advertisement at this point, doesn&#39;t it?).\n\nThe homepage for the game is at http://www.armageddon.org/\n\nTo play, point your telnet client to www.armageddon.org port 4050\n\nIf you&#39;re using Windows and are unsure how to do this, your best bet \nis to type in telnet://www.armageddon.org:4050 from the RUN command \nin your Start Menu.  I recommend you visit the homepage first.\n\nIf anyone&#39;s still interested and would like help, feel free to email \nme ( mailto:crayner@... ) and I&#39;ll be glad to.\n\nTake care guys.\n\n -Chris/Shayd\n\n\n"}}
