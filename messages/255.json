I am not quite\n&gt; happy about 1 thing, though.  How do I get the generators to generate\n&gt; monsters faster?  When I was playing the level (with illegimate\n&gt; team),\n&gt; I did not see any signs that the generators were actually doing\n&gt; anything.  How much free space do I need around a generator for it to\n&gt; work, if any?\n&gt;\n&gt; If anyone wants to test it, let me know and I will update it.\n&gt; Otherwise, I will just upload the whole thing at once and hope they\n&gt; are not too tough.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
