For pete&#39;s \nsake, those faeries freeze mages and archmages (my favorite \ncharacters) longer than anything else.  Yep, they freeze a fire \nelemental and clerics for less time with the same hit.  Why?\n\nThat brings me to an interesting question:  Is there anything in the \ngame that would keep a team of 1 from being frozen in place \nINDEFINITELY?  I mean a character could be surrounded by faeries and \ncontiniously fired upon and never have a chance to respond because of \nthe damn faeries.  \n\nOne more thing that bothers me about characters being frozen in\nplace: \nI had an archmage frozen in place and I could not make him do \nanything.  However, a few moments later (while the archmage was\nfrozen \n in place), the archmage summoned chain lightning.  Please explain \nthat one to me.\n\nOne more question:  is there anything that can BOTH block faeries\nfrom \n passsing through it AND allow character&#39;s attacks to penetrate it? \nI \ntried using rock tiles but faeries can still cross those.  If there\nis \nsuch a tile, I would like to know ASAP so I can redesign a certain \nscenario (#118) which I just finished.  That makes 3 original \nscenarios from me.\n\n\n"}}
