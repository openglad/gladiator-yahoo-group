Maybe it just because the problem is \nmultiplied.

The bug was\n&gt; that the AI would pick a victim in the beginning of the level and go\n&gt; relentlessly after him/her until it (the ai) was attacked by someone\n&gt; else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many a night has been spent trying to find the source of this bug, \nand\n&gt; just now Odo suggested that I try the dos binary for 3.8k. I tried \nit, and\n&gt; it turns out AI behaves that way there as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, most of my Gladiator memories come from 3.8G, which I&#39;ve \nplayed for\n&gt; years, but the AI in 3.8G is much more easy going. For example, the \nelves\n&gt; on the first level walk around the edges of the map instead of\n&gt; slaughtering your guys like madmen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does anyone know for sure how the AI was designed to act, or at \nleast how\n&gt; you guys expect it to act? The Snowstorm team will sleep easier at \nnight\n&gt; knowing that there are no AI bugs in Openglad (or at least be \nprepared if\n&gt; there _are_ bugs in there).\n&gt; \n&gt; - Zardus\n\n\n"}}
