I&#39;ve written\n&gt;out a basic outline of how the rules would work\n&gt;on my own, and would be happy to organize it, but\n&gt;I need to know if anyone would participate.\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d also like to have assistance by people in\n&gt;making the maps specifically for the tournament.\n&gt;I&#39;m thinking the first tournament set can consist\n&gt;of 3-5 levels, then we can release different\n&gt;mapsets, all of which will have to be started with\n&gt;a brand new gladiator team.\n&gt;\n&gt;Winning would mean you had the highest valued team\n&gt;of anyone--a valuation system I still haven&#39;t\n&gt;devised, but I think it would work like 100 coins\n&gt;per level per warrior, 200 coins per level per\n&gt;mage--and work out like that.  These coins, as\n&gt;well as your bare coin value combined with the\n&gt;level you&#39;re on would be used to determine your\n&gt;point stand on some kind of online ladder, that\n&gt;could either be posted on the main FSGames page\n&gt;or on my page.  (FSGames could just link to it\n&gt;then.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Tell me what you guys think...\n&gt;\n&gt;-Chris\n&gt;\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;           Free Games, Cash Prizes!\n&gt;Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!\n&gt;          http://www.onelist.com/ad/0\n&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n\n"}}
