Only an archmage does have a \nfighting chance of winning.  I tried with a mage.  The point of those \nwere to reach the limits, which I did and which is why I will never go \nback to those except for the 1.6 billion dollar one.  I need to figure \nout some better scenarios for measuring character strengths.  \nObviously, a wide open area is best, but against what opponent(s)?\n\nAnyways, I am starting to work on new scenarios that are going to be \npublished again.  A graveyard scenario is next (can&#39;t wait to test it \nout), and then something around the theme of &quot;The weakest link in a \nchain is the weak point of the entire chain&quot;.  After that, most of my \nscenarios will be built around a single character type.\n\n&gt; I&#39;d like to propose a new trainable stat: \n&gt; &quot;Not-running-around-like-a-chicken-with-its-head-cut-off&quot;. Even with \na \n&gt; zillion armor, nearby explosions tend to send my characters prancing \nall \n&gt; over the screen, running here and there and subsequently getting \nscared by \n&gt; ghosts. I mean, how shocked and bewildered is an archmage with \nseveral \n&gt; hundred intelligence going to be if a tower he was shooting at blows \nup?\n\nWait a minute.  I would like to have that stat for when I use \nexploding bolts with an Archer.  I mean if your character touched the \ninvulvernablity potion and is still invulnerable, he/she should never \nrun-around-like-a-chicken-with-its-head-cut-off.  The mega archers I \nhave created have a slight tendacy to run off for minutes after \nlaunching a few exploding bolts at close range.  That is despite the \neffect I use the formula &quot;Armor = Strength times experience&quot; for  mega \nArchers.  I mean I could never make a dent in my armor with that \nformula without you-know-what-happening.\n\nBTW, 8 messages were posted between this post and my last post.  \nConsider that a long period of time between my posts.\n\n\n"}}
