For anyone of you \nreading this thinking that you would like to participate in a \ntournament once everything&#39;s ready, nothing will be worked on until \nenough people show interest.\n\nIf we get to 15 people interested and depending on how the votes \nwere cast, I might have to open another poll to decide how many \nscenarios in the tournament and start having a discussion about which \nscenarios should be included.\n\nIf no person would mind sticking their necks out on the current \ntournament poll, I would adjust it to show who has voted so I could \ncount those who claim to be unable to reach the poll.\n\nWhy 15 people?  Putting together a tournament would take a lot of \neffort and I feel having less than 15 people wouldn&#39;t make the effort \nworth while.  If anyone would want to argue the point about miminium \nnumber of participants, please plead your case.\n\n\n"}}
