We&#39;re happy for them (D2 should be a GREAT game), but\nit&#39;s meant that progress on G:BF has slowed immensely :(\n\n&gt;what is arena gladiator fighting.\n\nAla the Romans, or (in current days) kind of like WWF wrestling .. people\ndress up funny and perform various stunts in competition with each other.\nUnrelated to the Gladiator game.\n\n&gt;how do you edit graphics.\n\nYou can use the program &quot;editor.exe&quot; in the Gladiator directory.  However,\nwe don&#39;t specifically support its use (too old and complicated), so you&#39;ll\nhave to hope someone on the list can give you a few pointers if you have\ntrouble with it.\n\n&gt;is the levels webpage up yet \n\nI don&#39;t think so.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
