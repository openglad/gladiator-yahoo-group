The number of \nlevels are limited, cheats don&#39;t exist, and the scenario picker is fairly \nuseless. If people completed the demo and sent in their save files, the \nperson with the highest total score would be declared winner. It would also \nsave a lot of administrative trouble.\n\nMy only problems with the scenario editor are that there&#39;s limited \npunctuation available in the text box and that some of the map tiles are \nnext to useless. That&#39;s why I created the pillar .PIX files... to replace a \ncouple of useless tiles.\n     -T.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
