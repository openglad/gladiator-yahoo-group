Any type of scenario editor will\nbe built from the ground up, or included into the game itself. There\nare other parts of the code, such as level.cpp and weap.cpp, that use\nsmoother to query tile types but that functionality could easily be\nadded without the use of smoother.\n\nWas there any new tile types you had in mind?\n\n&gt; *smiles* You&#39;re going to have to create new tile types sooner or\n&gt; later.  As I recall, there&#39;s only **let&#39;s see*** 3-4 places to change\n&gt; in order to add new map tiles.\n&gt; \n&gt; pixdefs.h\n&gt; radar.cpp\n&gt; scen.cpp\n&gt; loader.cpp\n&gt; level.cpp\n&gt; smooth.cpp (is this really used by anything other than the scenario\n&gt; editor?)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
