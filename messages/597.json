Beyond\n&gt; that, talk about Parts 1-3 is encouraged.\n&gt;\n&gt; The point of multiple parts is to keep discussion going at a steady\n&gt; pace [If it was just one giant wish list for everything, conversation\n&gt; probably would have died out by now].  When I switch to a higher part\n&gt; number, it means that I thought conversation about the current part\n&gt; was almost dead and I attempted to keep the mailing list active again\n&gt; by starting the next part.  So far, my strategy has been working for\n&gt; bringing this mailing list to a more active state.  In fact, we have\n&gt; surpassed previous records for number posts in a month at yahoo.\n&gt; Frankly, I hope discussion about part 4 will drag on and on and on and\n&gt; on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on . . .\nI agree, you have generated a lot of conversation recently, and shown that\neveryone still reads the list :)\nI hope we get lots of ideas and thoughts on part 4 when it&#39;s turn arrives,\nand I do think it will go on for a while, especially as all the previous\nparts can also provide ideas and topics for it.\n\n&gt; BTW, if someone\n&gt; wants to bring something else up, feel free.  My goal is to keep this\n&gt; list somewhat active.\nYou&#39;re doing a great job!\n\n&gt; Also a reminder:  15 people need to show interest in a tournament\n&gt; before I will start work on that.  I have asked Tom Ricket to put\n&gt; something on the FSGames website about a possible tournament.\nI&#39;ll be talking to a friend of mine and see if he wants to make a 2-man\nteam, I originally pucrhased gladiator because of it&#39;s multiplayer on a\nsingle machine capabilities - those seem to be exceptionally difficult to\nlocate on the &#39;net :)\nUnfortunately that was a few years ago and things have moved on (for a start\nI&#39;ve now got a small LAN :) and he may not have the time, we&#39;ll see though.\nAt any rate I can help with checking submitted games for cheating.\n\n&gt; One more requested feature:\n&gt;\n&gt; Search and replace objects.  Sometimes, I decide my opponents are\n&gt; either too weak or too strong and it would be very convient if I do a\n&gt; quick update on experience levels without having to delete lots of\n&gt; characters.\nAdded, there&#39;s an extra feature that goes with this which I saw in the\nSerious Sam editor (if you want to see one hell of an editor, it&#39;s it, as a\nbonus the game rocks too :) where you can clone objects, so say you could\nuse a bunch of identical enemy mages and if you changed one you could hit a\nbutton to change all the clones as well.\nSound useful? :)\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
