Is that the order that \nthe ties \n&gt; will be broken?  For example, there&#39;s a tie between two players, so \nthey play \n&gt; a tie-breaker scneario then if they tie there whomever doesn&#39;t have \na cleric, \n&gt; then if neither do, then whomever has a ghost, etc.\n\nvery good question.  The tie-breaker rules are listed in order.  I&#39;m \nalso emphasizing that there was strong opinion that the tie-breaker \nscenario (the first one rule) should resolve most (if not all) ties.  \nHopefully, by the time all 7 rules are gone through, all ties are \nbroken.\n\n\n"}}
