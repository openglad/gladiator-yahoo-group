Things have sure been busy around here the\nlast month or so because of it ... have any of you tried the special\nsingle-player map that lets four players go through in a Diablo-style map?\nIt&#39;s a pretty neat warping of the game :)\n \nAlso, I just wanted to give another &quot;good work!&quot; message to Zardus and\naglswapbuffers, who are getting the original Glad code to run on a modern\noperating system, natively in a window, and all that neat stuff -- it&#39;s\nreally cool to watch it progress!\n \n--Tom\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: bluedrgnkid@...

The Archmage can conjure 4+ fire elementals, while the thief\ncharms \npeople.                       \n\nAnd if Tom reads this, good job releasing WCIII ( I think he&#39;s at \nblizzard..... )\n\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"}}
