I&#39;d say less interesting.\nWell I believe the abilities should be balanced, so that no single character\nis outright &#39;the best&#39; in the majority of situations.\nObviously in the version of gladiator we have certain characters are not\nplayed, mainly because they are underdeveloped (like orcs, orc captains).\nCharacters should have their own strengths and weaknesses and particular\npurposes in the game.\nIt shouldn&#39;t make it less interesting (look at starcraft, well at least pre\n1.08, it was well balanced and that enhanced the fun factor) but rather\nshould make it more interesting, with more diverse parties being used rather\nthan everyone using a similar mix.\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n&gt; As powerfull as mages and archmages are, they both have a very strong\n&gt; weakness: faeries.  Clerics are next in line for strength, what are\n&gt; their weaknesses?  They can only summon new characters if you left\n&gt; blood stains on a scenario or some character has died.\n&gt;\n&gt; What about Druids, Thieves, and Elves?  Druids can summon the faeries\n&gt; that are the achilles heal of mages/archmages.  Thieves can turn\n&gt; invisible and keep attacking you, making them worthy opponents.  Elves\n&gt; can run into a forest and recooperate health without much fear of\n&gt; being attacked.  Ghosts can be used to chase away your opponents,\n&gt; while skeletons are near impossible to hit because of their speed and\n&gt; tunneling ability.  I could go on about every character being roughly\n&gt; equal if you exclude a few.  Each of those few has a weakness in their\n&gt; powers.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am tempted, when I finish my set of scenarios, to send a 100%\n&gt; legitimate team with a lot of characters through most available\n&gt; scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
