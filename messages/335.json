I \nrecently obtained a copy of the Warcraft II Battlechest (full basic version \nw/online matchup and expansion levels) and found that .PUDs are \nplayer-designed Warcraft levels, and those ones on the disk were all based \non The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. Naturally, I \ntried them out, and some of them kicked ass and some of them sucked. They \ngot me thinking: the three games I&#39;m involved in now are Warcraft, \nGladiator, and The Two Towers (a Tolkien-based Multi-User Dimension, \nhttp://angband.com/towers), and crossovers between the three would truly \nrock. Why not have Warcraft levels based on the stock Gladiator scenarios, \nor vice versa, or Tolkien-based scenarios with corresponding levels? I threw \nsome Greek mythology into the TevFifty, but I&#39;m thinking here of complete \nimmersion in the story. Gladiator has several advantages in this department: \nyou can include the story blurb, which can be very cool; you can name \ncharacters; you can see who the enemy is and go kill him, rather than having \nto sit there whacking farms and such. With Warcraft, you have better \ngraphics and the ability to wage war at sea and in the sky, but you can only \nuse the preprogrammed character names, and if you want a storyline you have \nto put it in a separate text file. The magic and the maps are about equal. \nAnyone have any ideas in this vein? Over the semester break I should have \nenough time to actually execute some of this stuff in the Tevildo style, and \nalso do that fanfic stuff I was talking about earlier with attached \nscenarios. I hope there are other people out there doing their own thing, \nand it&#39;s not just DPH and I creating. Ricky Derr, got any levels for us? \nShayd? Anyone? Oh, man... how cool would it be to just insert the code for \ndragons and death knights into Gladiator... (salivating) That&#39;s all for now. \nGood luck and regards,\n   -Tevildo.\n   http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html\n\nOh, did anyone get any use out of the altered rock graphics file I posted to \nthe Egroups site? That was just an experiment... I could alter basically any \nweapon or character .PIX. Just say the word.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
