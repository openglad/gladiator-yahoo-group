The big issue is making sure that the user can specify \nthe width and height of the maze as well width and height of the walls \n and spaces between the walls in the maze.  I wouldn&#39;t mind looking at \nmore samples of code though.  What other languages did you write the \nrandom maze generating code?\n\n\n"}}
