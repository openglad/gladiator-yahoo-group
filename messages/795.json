I can certainly\nstore the garbage chars when I read it in, but they&#39;ll be lost during the\nwrite-to-text-file process as they are not dumped out, and when I read it in\nI&#39;m likely to run ZeroMemory() over the variable first so any garbage will\nbe cleared.\nJust want to make sure I&#39;m not going to screw anything up, as running an\nautomatic comparison program over the original scenario file, and one thats\nbeen converted both ways (first to text, then back to scenario) won&#39;t work\nwell for testing it&#39;s correctness, since the &#39;garbage&#39; chars will be\ndifferent.\n\nAh well, hope to have it working within a few days, then maybe I&#39;ll work out\na better error handling system, right now it&#39;s a 4:1 line ratio for error\nhandling code : file read code.\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n*Goes back to looking at the rather amusing attempt of MSVC++ to display\nchar arrays that don&#39;t have a NULL terminator in them, I wish it would only\ndisplay the data thats in the actual array - it knows the length...*\n\n\n"}}
