I&#39;ll give you\n &gt; guys around 48 hours for some old topic to pick up before I decide\nto\n &gt; post &#39;The Fifty Project&#39; topic.\n &gt;\n &gt; What is this part about?  How to keep track of scores for the\n &gt; tournament and how to decide tie-breakers.  Is there a part 2 to\nthis\n &gt; topic?  I don&#39;t know yet.\n\nOk, folks, I know there are 6 other people out there interested in\nplaying in a tournament.  Somebody else is going to have to help\nwrite some rules.  If you are too scared to write rules in this area,\nlet me know by email and I will create another yahoo group just to\nwork on having a tournament.  The biggest reason I am afraid of\nwriting all the rules is someone later coming back and saying the\nrules are UNFAIR and he/she blaming me for writing the rules.  Since I\nam also a moderator of this group, that possibility could put me in a\nvery ackward position.  I hope you guys can understand why I am\nhesitating to write all the rules.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
