The original code\nused Watcom C++ (10.0a), along with some custom assembly routines for the\ngraphics and (I think) sound.  So some files will probably compile easily,\nwhile others will be more difficult.  I also don&#39;t remember if our original\ncode was 16-bit or 32-bit, so that may also take some tweaking.\n \nAnyway, I&#39;ve zipped up everything of our source -- it&#39;s about 4.5 megs with\nall the gunk.  If need be, I can create a pared-down version of just source\nfiles and existing data files.  I&#39;ve also created a &quot;Tom Ricket&quot; account at\nSourceForge and posted a comment in the forums .. let me know what&#39;ll work\nbest.\n \nFor the licensing -- yes, it&#39;s been long enough (and we&#39;re not working on it\nanymore), that we&#39;d be happy to provide it under a standard open source /\nGPL / something-or-other license .. let me know what you need and I can get\nany standard forms listed :)\n \n--Tom\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Zardus@...

All of the original FSGames team\n&gt; is tied up 150% with Blizzard stuff, so we haven&#39;t had time to work on\n&gt; Gladiator in quite a while ... so anything we can get you to help with\n&gt; code, we&#39;d be happy to supply.\n\nWe havn&#39;t thought of a name, but OpenGlad is a good idea :-).\n\nWe&#39;d love to have access to the source, yes. Can it be provided under an\nopen source license? Instead of making a clone from scratch, we could then\nport it to SDL (or some other cross-platform graphics library) and improve\nit from there.\n\n\nAlso,\n\nOn Mon, 17 Jun 2002, dph_of_rules wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to have access to enough of the code to produce a/some\n&gt; new version(s) of the existing game.\n&gt;\n\nDph, if you want to help us out at the Gladiator clone project on\nSourceforge, you&#39;re very welcome to join. If you&#39;re intersted, make an\naccount on Sourceforge and email me or post to the forums or something,\nand I&#39;ll hook you up.\n\nThe same goes for anyone else interested to help. I think we&#39;ll get alot\nmore done if we&#39;re all working on one project instead of 2 or 3 different\nones.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
