A level 5\nmage with 20 intelligence has more mana than a level 1 mage with 20\nintelligence.  Gladiator was programmed in C, which has limits to the\nvariables -- when these limits are crossed, the variables plunge into the\nrealm of negatives.  Various calculations that the game performs could\ncause program upsets that causes it to crash.\n\nThe reason that your editor and game crashes when your grid is too\nlarge is probably because the game does not allocate enough memory\nfrom the heap to hold the data effectively.  This anomoly is, once\nagain, good recipe for a crash.\n\nThe reasons behind this are probably because you&#39;re pushing the game\nto its limits.  I believe that, fundamentally, gladiator should be able to\n\noperate on a 386 without too much hampering by the system&#39;s\nresources (or lack thereof).  I think that this is how the game was\noriginally designed without enormous scenarios being taken into mind.\n\nThis touches again on my proposal that the level designers out there\ndesign scenarios with a starting team in mind -- without the\nexpectation that the player&#39;s characters will reach levels in the\nhundreds.\n\ndph of rules wrote:\n\n&gt; Yep, it&#39;s true.  I crashed Gladiator again.\n&gt; I had the following stats for my mega-archmage:\n&gt; str 139\n&gt; dex 141\n&gt; con 139\n&gt; int 151\n&gt; arm 140\n&gt; At what experience level, do the following stats cause the game to\n&gt; crash?  Why is that I can play against experience level 4000 slime\n&gt; without crashing the game, but everytime my character crosses over\n&gt; experience level 500, the game crashes?\n&gt;\n&gt; By the way, I have discovered that a grid too big crashes the scenario\n&gt;  level editor and the game.  In other news, I created a scenario with\n&gt; enough gold to give a player 1.6 billion dollars.  It takes a while\n&gt; for that scenario to load, though.\n&gt;\n&gt; In case you were wondering, I went from experience level 270 to\n&gt; experience level 572 in one scenario, fighting experience level 1000\n&gt; slime at skirmish.  Of course, I had some potions of magic, flight,\n&gt; invulnerability, invisibility, and speed to assist me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Will someone from FSGames please respond to this message?\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n"}}
