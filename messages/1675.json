If you are going to \nhave a power of cast spells of protection, there should be an \nalternate of &quot;remove spell of protection&quot;.  Of course, IMHO one major \nbug in the game is killing a character does not remove the spell of \nprotection surrounding the character.  Also, there should be some \nlimits on how many trees can be created by the druids on each team.  \nExcessive amounts of trees have a decremental effect on the speed of \nthe game [See my &quot;Druid Island&quot; scenarios in the torture set for an \nexample of the trees slowing down a scenario.]  I might suggest an \nalternate attack of &quot;remove trees&quot; (save time removing those trees) or \nan alternate attack of &quot;grow more trees&quot; (grow 8 trees surrounding \nyour druid at a time).\n\nI believe there should be a limit about how much time a faerie can \nkeep your character frozen without having a chance to escape the \nsituation.  Also, faeries do need another attack.  I would suggest \ngiving high experience level faeries the ability to carry teammates \nshort distances over water and forested areas.\n\n*upcoming topics*\n\nNext week is Golems and towers.\n\nAfter that, it&#39;s Giant Skeletons and Fire Elementals.\n \nAfter that, it&#39;s skeletons and ghosts.\n \nAfter that, it&#39;s clerics and archmages.\n\nAfter that, it&#39;s orc captains and thieves.\n \nAfter that, it&#39;s proposed new character classes - not promotions or \nhybrids/dual class.\n\nAfter that, it&#39;s more proposed new character class - promotions of \nexisting classes only.\n\n*end upcoming topics*\n\n\n"}}
