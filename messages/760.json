The scenarios will be\nstart from startch with a brand-new team (not an experienced team).\n\nHow do I propose getting this accomplished?  By doing this in parts.\nLOL.\n\nPart 1 will be about creating TEXT for the scenarios and a basic\ndescription for the scenarios.  This description will include list of\nopponents, named opponents, friendly NPCs, named friendly NPCs, and a\ndescription of the grid.  I expect this to take from 100 to 150+ days\nto do 50 scenarios.\n\nPart 2 will be about creating the scenarios, incoporating the text for\nthe scenarios.  I expect this to take from 300 to 350+ days for 50\nscenarios.\n\nPart 3 will be about dedugging and testing scenarios.  I expect this\nto take 100 to 150+ days.\n\nPart 4 will be about putting them all together in an archive and\nposting them online - approximately all of 5 hours tops.\n\nIn addition to doing these by part number, these are also going to be\ndone by part letter.\n\nA will be about working on the 1st 5 or so scenarios.\nB will be about working on the 2nd 5 or so scenarios.\nC will be about working on the 3rd 5 or so scenarios.\nD will be about working on the 4th 5 or so scenarios.\nE will be about working on the 5th 5 or so scenarios.\nF will be about working on the 6th 5 or so scenarios.\nG will be about working on the 7th 5 or so scenarios.\nH will be about working on the 8th 5 or so scenarios.\nI will be about working on the 9th 5 or so scenarios.\nJ will be about working on the 10th 5 or so scenarios.\n\nWhy 5 scenarios at a time?  To keep from filling overwhelmed.\n\nSo what will happen I will start with 50 Project?  I will start tih\n50P: Part A1.  Once A1 is completed, Part A2 will start and so will\nPart B1.  This same pattern will continue.\n\nTelvido, I ask you to write the basic story arc for these 50 as you\nvolunteered to do so.\n\nAre there any catches?  Yep.  If somebody should ever start working on\nGladiator:Beyond Freedom, they will get free access [nobody working on\nthat part gets ANY money from doing so] to the scenario descriptions\nso that they can equip that game with 50 scenarios.  Anyone else who\nwants access to the descriptions also gets free access.\n\nBefore we start this project, I will ask for a minimum of 8\nvolunteers: at least 2-3 people to create scenarios and everybody to\nhelp with debugging and creating text and descriptions for scenarios.\n\nWhat will I be doing during this project?  Keeping things on track;\ngoing through the membership list to remove bad email addresses and\ncheck to find more people interested in a gladiator tournament; and\nworking on both my own scenarios and the 50 Project Scenarios.\n\nAbout the name for this project, any better name will be considered\nand probably be used.\n\nTo be honest, I don&#39;t expected this project to generate that many\nmessages posted to this group.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
