You see, my mega archmage has so \nmuch magic power that the number is displayed as a negative number.  \nThe perks are that I can go through any scenario now as if I had never \nplayed it.  The bad is my mega archmage can not perform any attacks. \n:-(\n\nHis stats are as follows: str 3000; dex 3000; con 3000; int 7000; \narmor 3000; level 525.  I guess he could be considered forced into \nretirement. :-(.  It is not fair.  I only wanted to be able to perform \nany attack without the possibility of running out of magic power \nunless time was frozen.  :-(  Is that too much to ask?\n\nCould someone at FSGames please give me a formula I can use to make \nsure that in the future, none of my characters accidentally crosses \nover with having too much magic power?  I promise not to share the \nformula with anyone else or use the formula to create a game of my \nown.\n\nBTW, I would like to ask for the title of Expert on all characters \nwhose experience level is greater that 100.\n\n\n"}}
