If so, this is your week to discuss those ideas.\n\n  I&#39;ll start with a brand one:\n\n  gargoyle character class\n  basic attack - claw a character in front of it or tail whip a\n  character behind it\n  special attacks\n  1)glide - this allows the character to glide short distances over\n  trees and water (basic attack won&#39;t work while gliding for obvious\n  reasons)\n  2)hibernate - this allows the character to turn to stone for healing.\n  During this process of healing, 95% of the damage from any attack on\n  the character is automatically deflected while mana is used to restore\n  health.  Hibernation ends either after all mana is exhausted or the\n  character is in full health.\n\n  It&#39;s ok to disagree with the moderator.\n\n\n        Yahoo!
