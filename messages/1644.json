(IE: normal\n&gt;   arrow, but always insta-death)\n&gt;\n&gt;   I think it sounds cool, but it might unbalance the game. Also might\n&gt;   need to change explanation.\n&gt;\n&gt;   For the Orcs:\n&gt;\n&gt;   Berserk - An Orc with enough power can bring upon itself rage in\n&gt;   which it may destroy anyting that stands in it&#39;s way. (Like Charge,\n&gt;   but kills everything it hits, including your own side so be careful)\n&gt;\n&gt;   I&#39;d appreciate feedback, although neither of these is incredibly\n&gt;   likely to reach Openglad Enhanced or Gladiator: Beyond Freedom...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
