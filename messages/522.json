I\nwill have to rely on the honor system (plus deadlines) to keep\nwould-be cheaters out.\n\nI would have to have a few basic rules to make it easy to check on\nteams.  You send your initial saved game [before your team goes\nthrough any scenarios] to the judges of the tournament.  Every 5 or so\nscenarios, you send your saved game to the judges.  YOu would have\nsomething like 2-3 weeks to complete five scenarios and regardless of\nhow many scenarios you have completed, you would send your file in.\nThis would mean that every scenario in the tournament can be completed\nin 30 minutes or less with a beginning team.  Scenarios like my\n&#39;Hedges&#39;, the stairs from tevfifty, the Labyrinth from the tevfifty\ncould not be in the tournament without reducing the number of required\nscenarios to be completed with the allotted time.\n\nTo create the prize money [if we wanted prize money], I would suggest\na small entry fee of $2-$5, with prizes for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
