I still \n&gt;cannot play with sound though. I have a soundblaster16 soundcard so I \n&gt;don&#39;t understand why that&#39;s not working. Also I have windows 98. Is there \n&gt;anyway to create a shortcut from windows to start the game? I appreciate \n&gt;all the helpful sugeestions from everyone. Thanks....\n\nFor the Soundblaster 16 .. I&#39;m not sure why that wouldn&#39;t work, offhand :( \nThat&#39;s the soundcard that I was using until just recently, and never had \nany problems with it. Do you know if your card is set to use &quot;non-standard&quot; \nsettings or anything? Or does anyone else have ideas?\n\nTo create a shortcut for the game -- just make a shortcut that points to \nthe &quot;Glad.exe&quot; program in the Gladiator folder. It doesn&#39;t have an icon, so \nit&#39;ll look like a blue &quot;DOS&quot; icon unless you pick another icon for it.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
