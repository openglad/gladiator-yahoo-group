I \nstill got to work out a small bug I found in it about counting bytes.\n\nAnyway, I am going to post what I have completed of text converter in \nthe files section within 1-2 days.  It will only read information out \nof files.  I&#39;ll need to run quite a few scenarios through it before I \nam 100% satisfied with its ability to read information from scenarios. \n It won&#39;t be fool-proof until I add the most of the functionality.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
