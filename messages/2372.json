Y=\r\nou guys should go check it out and support the project! If you have an Ouya=\r\n, we desperately need gameplay time and likes :-)\n\nThis super fresh version=\r\n of the game has a rebalance, a revamped level editor, and the ability to c=\r\nreate actual campaigns (as opposed to just levels in the main campaign)! Th=\r\nis will soon be coming to Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android as well!\n\nIf you=\r\n just can&#39;t wait for an Android update, Gladiator is already on Android, bu=\r\nt it&#39;s the prior version without the new updates for now, because the focus=\r\n was on the Ouya port.\n\nAlso, we have a cool new website: http://openglad.o=\r\nrg\n\n- Yan\n\n\n"}}
