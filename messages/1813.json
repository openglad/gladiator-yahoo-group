This is, as\nthe non-enhanced branch of Openglad will forever remain, a bugfix release.\nMainly, it fixes the crashes that 0.97 had on retreat and, probably of the\nmost interest to many people here, it has working Windows joysticks! :-)\n\nJoystick support should be just plug and play. Launch the game up with\nyour joystic connected and you should be able to bind keys to it. Each\ndirection on an axis and each button are counted as an extention to the\nkeyboard, so setting keys to it shouldn&#39;t be a problem. One word of\nadvice, though: don&#39;t bind the diagonal directions, just use some garbage\nkey. Diagonal motion will be handled automatically.\n\nI also took care of a few minor Openscen annoyances, so its easier to edit\nthings near the edge of the map now. That&#39;s all I can remember right now,\nso have at it. Snowstorm&#39;s site is at http://snowstorm.sf.net and you can\nfind the downloads from there.\n\n- Yan\n\n\n"}}
