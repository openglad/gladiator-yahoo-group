This week \nwe will discuss one way they *might* be.\n\n1st off, all hybrid characters (in this category) belong to a special \norder (orders being living, weapons, treasures, etc) because there \nwill be lots of them (see point below for approximate number of \nhybrids using only existing characters).  To make a hybrid, both \nhired characters must be at least experience level *15* and it will \ncost between 1 million and 2 million points, depending on the \nabilities of the new hybird. (Some around 2 million points would be \nthe combination of archmage and cleric if you kept certain abilities) \n Not just any two character classes can merge to become a hybrid - A \ncharacter class and its promoted character class can&#39;t; slime and \narchmage can&#39;t because of concerns over potential chain-lightning \nproblems, and no hybrids with Golems, Giant Skeletons or Towers.\n\nHere&#39;s a rough list of how many hybrids there would be with the \n*existing* characters:\n\n1)slime (counting every class but archmage) - 14 hybrids\n2)soldier - 14 hybrids (not counting slime)\n3)elf - 13 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n4)archer - 12 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n5)mage - 10 hybrids (not counting classes above or its promoted class)\n6)skeleton - 10 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n7)cleric - 9 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n8)fire elemental - 8 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n9)faerie - 7 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n10)thief - 6 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n11)ghost - 5 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n12)druid - 4 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n13)orc - 2 hybrids (not counting classes above or its promoted class)\n14)orc captain - 2 hybrids (not counting classes above)\n15)barbarian - 1 hybrid (not counting classes above)\n\nThat makes a running total of *117* possible hybrids using only \n*existing* character classes.  Is there any question why I would \nrequest a brand new order just to handle hybrids?\n\nOh yea, how would attacks be decided?  Simple, each characters get to \ncontribute 2 attacks to the new hybrid.\n\nhow would stats be handled?  Take the sum of each individual from the \ncharacters and multiply it by 3/4 and that becomes the new stat.\n\n\n"}}
