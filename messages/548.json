I just sent an email requesting those vital info on scenario file\n&gt; formats.\n&gt; There were a few things I conceded about building a new program:\n&gt;   There would probably have to be password protection on said program\n&gt; similiar to the original.  Zipped file requires a pssword to unzip.\n&gt;   If there was legal documents to be signed to create a new scenario\n&gt; editor, all involved in creating a new one would have to sign\n&gt; documents.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
