How odd.\n&gt; \n&gt; nah, not really. the only scenarios i think were iffy opponent wise \n&gt; were the hedge ones, but that might have just been because it took a \n&gt; REAL long time gettin through there (soldiers atw!!). the brag was \n&gt; alright except for the doors.. that kinda took away from it. it was \n&gt; like, run across the level, kill 3 guys, get a key, repeat, repeat, \n&gt; repeat. the slimes musta been pretty hi-level too, they were hard to \n&gt; kill, as i remember.\n\n1)Going back and forth isn&#39;t too bad if you have a mage/archmage.  \nJust lay a teleporter marker right in the middle.  It&#39;s not too bad \nwith a soldier because you can charge your through it.\n\n2)The damn doors are my biggest complaint against the scenario.  Far \ntoo often, the damn doors are opened ahead of time.\n\n3)That was an experimental scenario.  You face lots of opponents, but \nnot too many at a time.  I&#39;d rather keep facing 5 or so opponents at a \ntime, have a few moments to recharge magical energy, and then go out \nagainst another small set of opponents.  The only alternatives [for \nhaving large number of opponents, but facing a few at a time] to \nhaving tons of doors is having tons of teleporters or really cramped \nspace.\n\n4)Admittedly, the 1st set of Hedges is a nightmare because of the \nelves.\n\n\n"}}
