After the 5 minutes have \nexpired, you would get 5 seconds of invunerability to the faerie \nattacks.  That would amount to about 1 second of invunerability to \nthose attacks per minute frozen by the attack.  In the case of the \nmage/archmage, I&#39;d use the 5 seconds either to use the heartburst \nattack to kill those annoying faeries or to teleport the heck away \nfrom faeries.\n\nFrankly, I believe that the invulnerability potion should be able to \nblock the effects of that attack, because it blocks the effects of \nevery other attack.\n\nI believe that faeries should be able to shoot out their attack in \nmultiple directions.\n\nAbout those druids, I have a question: can an exp level 10 druid \ncreate &quot;stronger&quot; trees than an exp level 1 druid?  Oh yea, druids \nshould not be able to put more than 6-10 spells of protection around a \ncharacter.\n\n\n"}}
