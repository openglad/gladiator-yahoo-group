It does run (at insanely high\nspeed, go P600...) and has at least 1 or 2 levels buried in it.\nThe file is ~17MB, and I don&#39;t know if the above link still works - I still\nhave it, and DPH is right, the yahoo groups file storage has (just) enough\nspace to hold it.\n\nHowever there is one minor problem - the software is actually owned by the\nForgotten Sages, and thus you&#39;ll probably find that the copy we have\nactually falls under the &#39;warez&#39; category and so it&#39;s likely to be\nprohibited by Yahoo :)\nTo get around that we simply need someone from FS to tell us we can upload\nit, and maybe put a note somewhere in the groups online presence so Yahoo\ndoesn&#39;t go deleting it.\n\nAnyway, I&#39;ll try to upload it once FS gives us the go-ahead, hopefully my\nmodem connection won&#39;t fall apart part way through it - does anyone know if\nyahoo can resume transfers?\n\n- Deathifier\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, September 10, 2001 5:52 AM\nSubject: [gladiator] Re: Hey...\n\n\n&gt; --- In gladiator@y..., &quot;Rory Wilde&quot; &lt;laughingmadman@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t Tom post the demo of G:BF somewhere before?\n&gt;\n&gt; Hehe.

The link on FS Games website has not worked and still\n&gt; does not work.  There is enough space in this group to upload all of\n&gt; Gladiator:Beyond Freedom in the files section.
