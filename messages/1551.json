(On the other hand, this could easily become a \nbasis for how to implement chain lightning because the problem is \nsimiliar)\n\nI have decided to drop the whole door/key thing.  A couple of reasons:\n1)doors are pretty dependent on team number\n2)right now, there is no easy way to move objects around in a scenario \nso randomly placing them is a bad idea. \n\n\n"}}
