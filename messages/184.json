I \ncurrently use 3 of every type but Thief (I just sent my registration \nmoney in the mail today).\n\nI have a difficult time getting through the level with Tic and Tac in \nit without characters dying.  The only way I beat that level without \nlosing any characters is if all my characters act as a team instead\nof \n individual efforts.  Does the registered work on getting your team\nto \n work as a team 100% of the time?  I would have to say Tic and Tac is \nthe hardest level next to the last level.  Is it underrated as \nmoderate?\n\n\n\n"}}
