Only 1 small \nthing, though.  That scenario is designed to have enough gold to bring \ncharacters beyond experience level 100.  I created that scenario so I \nwould have a fast way of evaluating each characters where essentially \nthe only weaknesses (and something else listed below) of the \ncharacters are the available attacks.\n\nOne side note, though.  All of the characters I have tried at \nexperience level 100+ have problems using teleporters because they run \ntoo fast.  I believe they run at least twice as fast as their attacks.\n\n\n"}}
