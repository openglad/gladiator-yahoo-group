WAIT A MINUTE! In the \nshort term, combining old attacks could be a good idea...\n\nNew explanations:\n\nDoom Arrow - A seemingly normal arrow is fired, but it is cursed to \ndo more damage even than an explosive one.\n\nBerserk - An Orc, when powerful enough, can deliberately go berserk \nfor a short time, during which it deals death to all foes.\n \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;   From: doomlordx &lt;doomlordx@y...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, February 13, 2003 1:24 PM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: [gladiator] Abilities for Orcs and Archers\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Suggestions so far are good, I like Ethereal Arrow, but here&#39;s a\n&gt; &gt;   weird Archer ability I thought of.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Doom Arrow - A seemingly normal arrow is fired, but it is \ncursed so\n&gt; &gt;   that it will instantly slay the first enemy it hits. (IE: normal\n&gt; &gt;   arrow, but always insta-death)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   I think it sounds cool, but it might unbalance the game. Also \nmight\n&gt; &gt;   need to change explanation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   For the Orcs:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Berserk - An Orc with enough power can bring upon itself rage in\n&gt; &gt;   which it may destroy anyting that stands in it&#39;s way. (Like \nCharge,\n&gt; &gt;   but kills everything it hits, including your own side so be \ncareful)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   I&#39;d appreciate feedback, although neither of these is incredibly\n&gt; &gt;   likely to reach Openglad Enhanced or Gladiator: Beyond \nFreedom...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   Your use of Yahoo!
