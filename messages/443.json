(Same with bone piles, BTW)\n\nLevel 401 was kind of sad, it was just gold piles and 12 level 1 \nfaeries...\n\nLevel 402... I just moved near the corner, held down enter...\n\nLevel 666, well, I watched the fight, laughed, then hit the remaining \nguy with MASSIVE overkill.\n\nI agree with the restriction on Archmages, although not entirely on \nClerics and Druids, however.\n\nArchmagi should only be able to have 1 fire elemental, because a \nlevel 150+ fire elemental summoned as soon as the battle starts makes \nit a BIT unfair.\n\nClerics, however, need to actually acquire a kill before they can use \nRessurection, and Druids&#39; summoning abilities are totally worthless. \nHave you ever USED Druids? Faeries that are summoned are level 1 NPC \nfaeries - in other words, they suck by the time you can chain-summon \nthem. Actually, I think that Druids&#39; protection needs restricted. You \ncan cast it so much that things totally blur out of existence, and \ncannot be hit with normal attacks for the next...100 hits. And I \nthink even one Protection is enough to stop a horde of normal Orcs \nfrom ever being able to harm you, although I may be wrong on this.\n\nIn conclusion... Archmages should get 1 fire elemental pet at most, \nand I&#39;ll have to check Clerics&#39; ressurect before I pass judgment on \nit. (Is it based on ressurected unit level or on Cleric level?) \nDruids need a cap on Protections, and Orc Captains need to have the \nOrcs&#39; specials.\n\nI&#39;m finishing up my set of levels, but I&#39;m not going to disclose any \ndetails. Yet.\n\n(Tip of the Message : The outlandish amount of over 4 billion coins \nis the most that you can possibly obtain.)\n\n\n"}}
