Sometimes \nI&#39;ll have other programs running in the background and I can chain fifty \nguys with no problem; sometimes I run it totally by itself from DOS and it \ntakes half an hour for the lightning to cycle through fifteen guys. I don&#39;t \nhave the fastest computer, but it shouldn&#39;t be crippled by something like \nthat.\n\nSomething I&#39;ve noticed: one of the only other things that will slow down \nGladiator is having a whole hell of a lot of elemental fire on the screen. \nBut that&#39;s ONLY if the fire is on the screen where you can see it. Once you \nstop sunbursting and the flames reach the edge of the visible field \neverything speeds up again. Usually this lag isn&#39;t significant, but it&#39;s \nnoticeable.\n\nHalf-classes made by merging two preexisting characters? How do you propose \nto make that thematic? &quot;The orc tears viciously into the druid, devouring \nhis flesh and gaining his skills!&quot; or &quot;After undergoing horrific operations, \nthe Archer finally healed... his old skeleton entirely removed and replaced \nwith the reanimated skeleton of a dead man.&quot; or &quot;The thief successfully \nstole the archmage&#39;s staff and cloak.&quot; I don&#39;t see how this could reasonably \nbe introduced, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.\n     -T.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
