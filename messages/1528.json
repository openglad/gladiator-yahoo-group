Don&#39;t worry: I have two other separate forms \nfor choosing which characters and which treasures to put on the \nscreen.  Coding the command button shouldn&#39;t be a problem since I plan \non stealing some of my own code I developed earlier.  Creating the \ntext validation might be tricky, though.  I&#39;m not too sure if giving \nthe user the option of choosing the scenario type; I may redo that as \na list box just to save time.\n\nPicking the grid file and dimensions is going to be tricky, though.  I \nam tempted to make the user pick an existing map to use and make the \nprogram read the grid file to pull out the available dimensions.\n\nAlso, I&#39;m wondering about allowing the program to pick random levels \nfor the different types of objects if the user supplies the range.\n\nI&#39;m also unsure of how to handle team numbers for the characters: Does \neach character get a randomly assigned team number; each character is \non the same team as the user chooses; or the user chooses x number of \nrandom characters to be on team 1, x number of characters to be on \nteam 2, etc?\n\nAlso, what about player positions/exits?  I am going to assume the \nuser will have to add an exit pointing to another scenario or should \nthe user get the choice about putting in one exit to whatever scenario \nlevel?  Also, should the program assign initial player start-up \npositions?\n\nAlso, here&#39;s a list of my assumptions: \n1)if a teleporter is choosen at random, you would always get a pair of \nteleporters (one by itself is useless unless you want to torment the \nplayer)\n2)if a door has x level and is on team y, then there is a key that has \nx level and is on team y.  The same is true in reverse with respect to \nkeys and doors. - [That presents any interesting question about how to \nhandle doors and keys]\n3)this program will not have intelligence enough not to place a \ncharacter and treasure in a &quot;bad&quot; location.  If somebody wants to add \nthat feature later, no problems.\n4)the user adds text later.\n\nWith the answers to these questions, I should have a program ready by \nSeptember 13.\n\n[I plan on traveling to visit an online friend on September 14 and \nwill be gone most of the day. :-) ]\n\n\n"}}
