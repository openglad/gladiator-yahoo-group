Groups Members,\n\nThe Yahoo! Groups service will be down for scheduled maintenance    \nFriday, March 15, 9:00 PM PST (GMT-8) as we move our servers to a new \nfacility. We expect the service to be restored the morning of Sunday  \nMarch 17.\n\nDuring this time the web site will be unavailable and email will not  \nbe delivered. (Some users may experience email non-delivery notices   \nwhile the service is down, but all email should be delivered once     \nservice is resumed.) Please note: once the service is restored, there \nwill be email delays due to backlog. We expect these delays to last   \nno longer than 1 day. Please do not re-send email to your group as    \nthis will only add to delays.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nThe Yahoo! Groups Team\n\n\n"}}
