If you&#39;re intersted, make \n&gt; an account on Sourceforge and email me or post to the forums or \n&gt; something, and I&#39;ll hook you up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Admittedly, the only thing I can readily contribute is the list of \n&gt; changes and the order in which to do them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Believe or not, your moderator of this group feels overcommitted \n&gt; working on some projects within TGS staff - tgs.gargoyles-fans.org \n&gt; - and not all of the work that I am doing will be visible within \n&gt; stories.  Even worse, I see no immediate end to my overcommitment \n&gt; because I have yet another project sitting on the back burner that \nI \n&gt; will pursue once I lower my level of committment.\n\n\n"}}
