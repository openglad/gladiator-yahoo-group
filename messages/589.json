Well, I \nbelieve some people are working on that.  Part 2 was about existing \ncharacters.  This part will be about adding new characters.\n\nMore generators:  Specifically, a Faerie generator.\n\nDefinitely another class of Mages: Practical Mage.  When the mage \nreaches the point of choosing to become an Archmage, it can also \nchoose to become a Practical Mage.  Yea, it has the basic attacks plus \nteleportation and ability to create a teleporter marker.  2nd attack, \nteleport teammates.  Alternate: Teleport opponents.  3rd attack, \ncreate teleporter,  This would require an existing teleport marker.  \nNote: all teleporters created by a Practical Mage are linked.  \nAternate to teleporters:  Black hole.  Walking in it kills friends and \nfoes alike.  Size and duration is determined by stats on Practical \nMage.  Freeze time is 4th attack.  Just a carry over from Mage&#39;s \nattacks.  Alternate: Slow down time.  Watch as your teammates are able \nto move twice as fast as your opponents.  Magic is regenerated at \nnormal time.  \n\n\n"}}
