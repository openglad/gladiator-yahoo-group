But in some spare time I&#39;ve written up a bit more for my gladiator_story.rtf.\n\nSomehow, my email address got disconnected by yahoo! groups for some reason, so I&#39;ve been missing out on the email for some time now.\nOnce again, come check it out at www.angelfire.com/rpg/zjackrum . Anyone who liked chapter one I hope will continue to enjoy the story I&#39;m beginning to unravel.\nApologies to Tevildo. I actually was taking care to spell your name properly, but somehow that extra L got in there anyway. It&#39;s fixed now, man!\nDeathifier: Don&#39;t suppose you got a better name in mind? It doesn&#39;t work too well as a cleric&#39;s name...\nAnyone else: Need a name for the new character introduced.... If you&#39;re on the list and you want to be famous, gimme and email and I&#39;ll set you up.\n\nAs always, post replies either here or to my email address, where they will be keyword-searched for words like &quot;Like&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and &quot;awesome&quot; and if I don&#39;t find them i&#39;ll email-bomb them back to you :)\n\nSome feedback would be nice as to where to go for chapter 3....\n\nOne last thing: I&#39;ve re-registered at yahoo groups under the nickname Zjackrum, which is my new alias. In the next edition of gladiator_story.rtf, the Trahern character will be switched to Zjackrum, which I prefer.\n-Trahern/Zjackrum\n\n\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free! \r\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143 \r\n\r\n\n\n"}}
