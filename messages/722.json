The archmage-cleric combination would be the most threatening \nto most people, whereas a soldier-archer combination wouldn&#39;t be as \nthreatening.  However I am more scared of a slime-anything else \ncombination for one reason: you could quickly raise up an army of high \nmobility characters.\n\n2nd, I believe in restricting the making of halfings until both \npotential partners have reached experience level 20 or higher.  That&#39;s \nnot going to be an easy task of getting two characters beyond \nexperience level 20 (only way to get there far would be too go through \n all the built-in scenarios, all the tevfifty, and then go through my \nscenarios to reach that point.)\n\n\n"}}
