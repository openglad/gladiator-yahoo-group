I\n&gt; would suggest \n&gt; giving high experience level faeries the ability to\n&gt; carry teammates \n&gt; short distances over water and forested areas.\n\nWould be a nice ability if one was playing\ncooperatively - or a nice way of throwing AI troops\ninto the line of fire so you aren&#39;t getting shot quite\nso often. \n\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
