See message \n#1231 for a list of topics that I am going through for the upcoming \nweeks.  There is a new poll out.\n\nThe editor project hasn&#39;t gone anywhere.  The 50 Project has been put \non hold so that the tournament group can get some help working on a \nplot for the tournament scenarios.  Note: that&#39;s what the poll is \nabout: whether or not the tournament scenarios NEED a plot.\n\nAs soon as the tournament group gets over the plot problem for the \ntournament scenarios, I plan on starting up on the 50 Project Again.  \nI am pretty happy with the proposed plotline so far (I&#39;ll forward it \nto the list at that time).\n\n\n\n\n"}}
