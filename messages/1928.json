The possibility is\n&gt; definitely there. If\n&gt; anyone has any good ideas, email me and let me know.\n\nI&#39;m not familiar with Lua, so I don&#39;t really know if\nthe &quot;common man,&quot; so to speak, would have an easy time\nscripting classes. I personally prefer Python as a\nscripting language, but then again, a Python\ninterpreter would probably make Openglad a *little*\nbit bigger than it needs to be. However, I&#39;ll just say\nthis: letting people script their own classes means\nnothing if they can&#39;t figure out how to do it. But I\nguess you already knew that, and I&#39;m just trying to\nshow that someone besides DPH cares about Gladiator.\n\n&gt; Also, if there&#39;s a Windows SDL guru listening, help\n&gt; me with fullscreen\n&gt; in windows!\n\nSorry, I&#39;ve no SDL experience. ;-(\n\n=====\n&quot;That which is truly wisdom will seem like foolishness to a fool, and that which is truly foolishness will seem like wisdom to a fool.&quot;\n- Proverbs\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
