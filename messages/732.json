That would put archmages and\n&gt; &gt;clerics more in check.\n&gt; \n&gt; unless you give faerie&#39;s a bigger boost or make druids summon hight \nlevel \n&gt; ones i propose you don&#39;t give the restriction th druids. because of \nthere \n&gt; faerie&#39;s low level the only thing they can do is lummon loads of \nthem.\n\nPoint taken.  Exclude druids from this restriction until such a time \nas they can summon more powerfull faeries.\n&gt; \n&gt; you could allow half-slimes if splitting halved a persons exp i know \nit \n&gt; already lowers it but i don&#39;t know by how much that way you would \nhave 50 \n&gt; level 1 greenish archmages instead of 1 level (20+20-10=) 30 \narchmage\n\nI must not have made this clear enough:  I am AGAINST half-slimes.  I \nconsider half-slimes to be potentially the most powerfull halfings; I \nbelieve they would be too powerfull because they could split right \nbefore you destroy the character, rendering them almost unbeatable.\n\n\n"}}
