I don&#39;t want to give too much away, but\nI took the three guys I see most on the forum and used\nyour names for characters in the book. I hope I dont\ndisapoint anybody.\nI mention Tom Ricket in there too. He should be happy,\nbecause he&#39;s obtained God status!\nAnd a late apology to Deathifier, who I saw post\nyesterday, but isn&#39;t in the story yet.\n\nCheck it out and post feedback to me, or through the\nforum. Thanks.\n-Trahern\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nMake PC-to-Phone calls with Net2Phone.\r\nSign-up today at: http://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?121\r\n\n\n"}}
