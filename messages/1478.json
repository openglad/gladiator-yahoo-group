If you want it, download the latest from CVS. The\nvery latest doesn&#39;t compile cause I accidently committed sound code that\nwas halfway through being finished.\n\nHowever, before I accidently committed that, the code compiled and worked.\nThe game works great under Linux except for sound, joystick, and some ai.\nI don&#39;t know if it compiled under any other OS. As for sound, that\nprobably won&#39;t get done until after I get back from Defcon.\n\nA new graphics system would be pretty tough. Odo\n(aglswapbuffers@...) is in charge of that area, so anyone that\nwants to help should contact him.\n\nAs for the site, our webmaster has been on vacation and didn&#39;t set the\npermissions right, so we couldn&#39;t update the site. He&#39;s coming back soon\nand will update.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
