Nothing in the source code to suggest an immunity. Are you\nsure it had absolutely no effect, like the skeleton&#39;s HP didn&#39;t\ndecrease at all? \n\nWell, I didn&#39;t gain any experience points when I used my heartburst\nattack agains the Giant Skeleton in question.\n\n&gt; Any chance that it was invulnerable?\n\nThere&#39;s a 350% chance that it was vulnverable - 1)I designed that\nscenario and there are no invulnerablity potions in it and 2)my mage&#39;s\nregular attack was having an effect.\n\nI was testing my new version of Scenario 121.  I&#39;m very happy with my\nnew map [solved a lot of the crowding problems walking through\ndiagonal tree lines :-) ] , but I feel like it needs a few more\ntreehouses.\n\n* * * *\n\nI found something really valuable: I was working on an easier way to\ndesign scenarios by exception-handling.  The user would specify the\ndefault map tile and then list the areas where there was an exception\nand what to place in the exception.\n\nI got it work with putting a line on a map and doing a box shape, but\nI was totally confused about doing a generic polygon.\n\nThe problem was how to know for sure that I was picking changing the\ntiles inside the polygon and not outside.  I got the program to do all\nthe lines for each side, but never did complete the part about how to\nknow beyond a doubt that I&#39;m picking points on the inside of the\npolygon, not the outside.\n\nDoes anybody know the solution to my dilemna?\n\n\n"}}
