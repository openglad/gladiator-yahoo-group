It would require\npatching the game, probably pretty much rewriting a large portion of it\neven I suspect or the folks at fsgames would already have done it.  It\nwould be cool, but I think I can safely say there is absolutely no\nchance of it happening.&quot;\n\ncouldn&#39;t you write a small R.A.T., that only lets you control certain keys. \nthat way you&#39;d get around having to rewrite most of Gladiator.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
