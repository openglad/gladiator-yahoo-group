I was giving them names, so I could tell them\n&gt; apart (That&#39;s a hint: there are more teleporters in this scenario than\n&gt; any other I have created).  I decided, for fun, to try out the\n&gt; scenario converter on the file and I learned something: The last\n&gt; object to be placed on the map is the first object listed in the file\n&gt; unless the converter flip-flops the order.\n\nInteresting, the converter won&#39;t flip the order of objects, it works on FIFO\nbasis - reads in object from file, puts it at end of object list (so first\nobject is on top, last object is on the bottom) and then when it writes back\nout it starts from the top of the list, so you should get the exact same\norder.\nThe actual editor probably just places newly created objects at the top of\nthe list (an alternative is the bottom) for speed reasons - insert at\nfront/back of lists and most other sequential strucutres is constant whereas\ninsertion into the middle may not be.\n\n&gt; To get the teleporters to\n&gt; work in the order I wanted them to go, I had to place themn in reverse\n&gt; order, but the map file shows them in the correct order.\n\nI&#39;m not quite sure if that means the converter is not working right :)\nI take it the map file is whats open in the editor?\n*Looks confused*\n\n&gt; That brings me to another feature for the new scenario editor: ability\n&gt; to take a set of teleporters and change the order in which they would\n&gt; work.\n\nThat sounds useful, especially for long chains, and it shouldn&#39;t be very\nhard to do either.\nI&#39;ve added it to the editor file and I&#39;ll clean it up and upload it to the\ngroups downloads area so others can see it.\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n\n"}}
