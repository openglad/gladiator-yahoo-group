The problem\nwith that is I can&#39;t run an automated file comparison program over it :)\nSo what I would like are some people to suggest files I should convert to\ntest, and I&#39;ll run them through and put them up on my site so they can be\nchecked.\n\nRight now I ran through a few of DPH&#39;s torture scenario&#39;s (I know they are\nall V8 :) and those are up at www.twarriors.com/deathifier with the filename\nGSCTest.zip and they looked fine to me.\nInside the zip file is some information, and you will need the PIX files\nfrom the torture pack to play and test them.\nIf you find any discrepancies please let me know, if people don&#39;t want to\nwait for me to test them I can modify the program a little so you can\nconvert scenario file to scenario file temporarily yourself and do whatever\nyou want.\n\nOnce this part is verified to work properly I&#39;ll do the last 1/4, hopefully\nin the next couple of days (uni is going back so it could be a few more) and\nthen it&#39;ll be complete :)\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
