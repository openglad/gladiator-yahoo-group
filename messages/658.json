Or a promotion on our basic \nsoldier?\n\nHow about adding halfing classes (mixture of two character types) if \nthey both have experience levels above 20? Like combining a &#39;High \nPriest&#39; with an &#39;Archmage&#39; would result in two characters which each \nhave half its original abilites and half the abilities of the other \none.  The catch: all the specials must be present between the two of \nthem: example both of them couldn&#39;t have the power of &#39;Heal&#39;, &#39;Summon \nImage/Summon Fire Elemental&#39;, etc.  You could NOT put halfings in a \nscenario to fight against.  \n\nIn case you were wondering, my combination of those two would be one \nhaving &#39;Wide area heal/Greater Heal&#39;, &quot;Resurrect/Reincarinate&#39;, \n&#39;Teleport/Leave teleporter marker&#39;, and &#39;Summon Image/Summon Fire \nElemental&#39;; the other half would have the rest of the abilites of \nboth.\n\n\n\n"}}
