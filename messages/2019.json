Tried the following searches:\n&quot;Gladiator&quot; - not surprisingly, snowstorm was not in the top ten results.\n&quot;fsgames gladiator&quot; - snowstorm&#39;s page was the first result\n&quot;openglad&quot; - again snowstorm was the first result\n&quot;gladiator fsgames&quot; - snowstorm came up seventh, but several other related \nlinks were also present.  Interestingly enough, my unoficial gladiator page \nthat I made years ago was the top result for this search ;P. I should \nprobably update that w/ a link to snowstorm.\n\nSo it seems easy enough to find, I wonder why these people don&#39;t try five \nminutes of googling first. . .\n\nOn Wednesday 10 March 2004 08:23, alternate_dph@... wrote:\n&gt; I was hoping that somebody else would have answered this question by\n&gt; now.
