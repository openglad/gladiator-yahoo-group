I&#39;d say less interesting.\ni disagree, as it is i would only ever play a mage, archmage, cleric, \narcher, solder, thief. i am really board of these charecters and\nwan&#39;t a change in the next game. We don&#39;t make them the same, just equal. \nsome could be better at bruit forse and others at\nstelth etc. and we could make some weak against others.the only negitave \nthis would give is you&#39;d need to make npc opponents\nlower levels to componsate for the boosts but it would give you a much \nbigger chouce of hirable charecters which would make it\ntake longer for me to tire of the game.\n&gt;As powerfull as mages and archmages are, they both have a very strong \n&gt;weakness: faeries.\nnot as big a deal as you make out. Sure they freeze (arch)mages for longer \nthen everyone else, but whenever there&#39;s a\nmomentary brake in the freezing a (arch)mage can teleporte away were as, say \nan archer can only take out, around 3 faeries\nwith 1 exploding bolt.\n&gt;Clerics are next in line for strength, what are their weaknesses? They can \n&gt;only summon new characters if you left blood stains on a scenario or some \n&gt;character has died.\nI don&#39;t know about you but when i play my cleric a accumulate alot of blood \nstanes vary quickly...\n&gt;What about Druids, Thieves, and Elves? Druids can summon the faeries that \n&gt;are the achilles heal of mages/archmages. Thieves can turn\n\n&gt;invisible and keep attacking you, making them worthy opponents.\n\nok but the computer doesn&#39;t use these steatigys enoughto make them wouth \nmentioning. if you play player vs. player they might\nbe even but in player vs. computer the 1st/2nt tear charecters have i heuge \nadvantage\n\n&gt;Elves can run into a forest and recooperate health without much fear of \n&gt;being attacked.\nhave you ever, once, seen the computer use this stratigy?\n&gt;Ghosts can be used to chase away your opponents, while skeletons are near \n&gt;impossible to hit because of their speed and\n\n&gt;tunneling ability.\n\nyes these are quite powerful, but who would ever play one of these when you \ncould be a cleric and summon them?\n\n &gt;I could go on about every character being roughly\n\n&gt;equal if you exclude a few. Each of those few has a weakness in their\n\n&gt;powers.\n\nok but for some the stringths greatly out number the weaknesses and for \nothers the vice versa\n\n&gt;I am tempted, when I finish my set of scenarios, to send a 100% legitimate \n&gt;team with a lot of characters through most available\n\n&gt;scenarios.\n\nok you will see how much harder it is then only using 1 archmage or cleric\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n\n\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\nReply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nTo: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [gladiator] Wish List Parts 2 + 3\nDate: Sat, 23 Jun 2001 22:20:09 -0000\n\nIf all characters in the game were roughly equal, would that make the\ngame more interesting or less interesting?
