Maybe in a similiar game with a science fiction theme. \n A robot would just look out of place among elementals and archers and other \nfantasy creatures.  I also thought of a promotion.  A druid could become a \nSorceror sometime that could summon special forest creatures like wolfs and \nbears and whatever.\n\n"}}
