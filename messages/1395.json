I&#39;m not a C++ programmer (Only VB), so I can&#39;t help \nin that section, but I&#39;m pretty good at drawing graphics and the like, \nso if there is anything that could use drawing, gimmie a ring.\n\nAlright, another VB programmer.  I am working off and on on a scenario \neditor in VB.  I have most of the functionality worked out (add \nobjects, deleting objects, modifying objects), but I just haven&#39;t put \ntogether the means of selection.  Right now, the only way I can do \nthat is by going inside my code and manually putting that in.  Would \nyou like me to email you all that I have put together for my scenario \neditor?\n\n\n"}}
