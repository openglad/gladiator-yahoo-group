Implementing a way for team 1 to\n&gt; have time slowed down while team 2 also has time slowed down while\n&gt; team 3 also has time slowed down . . basically, it can get\n&gt; interesting.  For example, suppose every team except numbers 7 & 8\n&gt; have time slowed down.  How exactly do you calculate how fast team\n&gt; numbers 7 & 8 work and be equitable to everybody else?\n\nwell, you could have it be like a counterspell for your team, if someone else \nhas already cast it.  ie, team 1 casts it, so everyone else slows down, then \nsome guy on team 2 casts it, and team 2 speeds back up to normal, while all \nother teams remain slowed. That seems like it should work. \nBjorn\n\n"}}
