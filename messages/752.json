Except for really small teams (4 or \nfewer), no single character should be able to exceed level 4.\n\nI&#39;m leaning towards 20 scenarios, which is what the poll says.\n\nAlso, no debate about tie-breakers?  Sheash, that oughta be seriously \ndebated right now before you finish the tournament and you get 2nd \nplace because one of your opponents choice of characters.\n\nThe first factors are about difficulty of going through scenarios and \nI felt it necessary to reward those people who had harder time \ntraveling through the tournament scenarios.\n\nSide note: (Frankly, I plan on using 2 clerics, 2 mages, and 1 elf or \nghost) through the tournament.  Think about that and what the \ntie-breaker rules were.)\n\nTo make things equal for everyone, things like how high experience \nlevel enemy clerics in the tournament needs to be available before \nstarting the tournament.\n\n\n"}}
