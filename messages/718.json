I&#39;ll give you \n&gt; guys around 48 hours for some old topic to pick up before I decide \nto \n&gt; post &#39;The Fifty Project&#39; topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is this part about?  How to keep track of scores for the \n&gt; tournament and how to decide tie-breakers.  Is there a part 2 to \nthis \n&gt; topic?  I don&#39;t know yet.\n\nOk, folks, I know there are 6 other people out there interested in \nplaying in a tournament.  Somebody else is going to have to help  \nwrite some rules.  If you are too scared to write rules in this area, \nlet me know by email and I will create another yahoo group just to \nwork on having a tournament.  The biggest reason I am afraid of \nwriting all the rules is someone later coming back and saying the \nrules are UNFAIR and he/she blaming me for writing the rules.  Since I \nam also a moderator of this group, that possibility could put me in a \nvery ackward position.  I hope you guys can understand why I am \nhesitating to write all the rules.\n\n\n"}}
