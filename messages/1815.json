My team\nmembers attack anything, regardless of level,\nvirtually ignore yell and protect orders, and scatter\nthemselves everywhere. It&#39;s extraordinarily hard to\nmake them act as a unit, unless I play at slow speeds\nand alternate between each character, dragging each\none out of danger in turn. At this level of AI, it&#39;s\neasiest to play a team of one.\n   -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier.
