Once you\nget to a level where your mana recharges fast enough, you just stay\ncloaked, and you can easily beat the normal campaign by yourself. To do\nit quick enough without cheating, though, you have to slime-farm\n(running in circles around slimes, keeping them confused until they\nmultiply, and then bombing a few of them to death, then repeat for a\nlong time). I havn&#39;t tried a solo thief on any custom levels, though.\n\nFor two-player mode, my favorite team is a druid and a thief. My friend\nwould be the druid and build us a base, then I&#39;d do hit-and-run missions\nwith cloak and he&#39;d go around planting trees on top of enemies (most\npowerful meelee attack in the game, I believe, even if its just a bug).\nGood times...\n\nOn Sun, 2003-09-28 at 23:22, Patrick Wong wrote:\n&gt; --- Daniel Paul Hightower &lt;alternate_dph@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; What&#39;s everybody&#39;s favorite teams?

Archers for using Explosive Bolt,\n&gt; Thieves for creating a line of traps you can&#39;t pass so\n&gt; that you don&#39;t dare engage in melee combat.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I try to do solo games (pretty hard), I tend\n&gt; towards Thieves, because then I can hurt the enemy\n&gt; while running away at the same time.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; The New Yahoo!
