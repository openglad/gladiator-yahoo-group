I can summon (with an \narchmage) an archer which can fire exploding bolts incredibly fast.  \nOf course, the attack can only be used long-range.\n\n\n&gt; for a fourth ability i&#39;m thinking that the archers should have \n&gt; a &quot;snipe&quot;, wherein they shoot one arrow that can go through walls \n&gt; (windows, as it were) as well as trees. this arrow would go faster \n&gt; than normal arrows and be much more powerful. it would also cost a \n&gt; mad amount of mana and go straight as an arrow.\n\nInteresting.  If there was a single arrow that could do that, I would \nwant to attach the ability to &quot;lock on target&quot;.\n\n\n"}}
