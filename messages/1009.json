I&#39;ll run an anti-virus program just to check that\n&gt; possibility.  I have gotten a certain virus sent to me in email\n&gt; repeatedly by different people, but I never opened the attachement.\n&gt; I&#39;m also going to make sure I can renumber the scenario because I used\n&gt; the scenario converter.
