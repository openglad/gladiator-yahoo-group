[Oh no, we&#39;re all doomed because dph was \nthinking.]\n\nPerhaps, archmages should be limited to summoning up to 5 images at a \ntime and 5 fire elementals at a time.  Once an image is killed, the \narchmage can summon another one and the same for a fire elemental.\n\nClerics should be limited to having 5 ghosts and 5 skeletons raised \nfrom the dead at a time.\n\nDruids would be limited to summoning 5 faeries at a time.\n\nAll this would make it harder for those characters to gain \nmega-experience in just a few scenarios.\n\n\n"}}
