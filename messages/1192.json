The other possibility is rocks lose their \neffectiveness as they travel through the forest.\n\nIt is not an issue for most people, unless we start creating lots of \nscenarios with elves that are that high experience levels.\n\nLike I have said before, you really don&#39;t know a character until you \nplay with the character at a really experience level. There is a lot \nto talk about if I get to &quot;game issues&quot;.\n\nThankfully, elves already have the impulsiveness of heading towards \ntheir oppponent.\n\n\n"}}
