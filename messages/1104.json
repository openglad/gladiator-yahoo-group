Resurrect works.\n&gt; \n&gt; You cast it on the shield?\nNo, you have to use resurrect before any of your team mates run over \nthe shield.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; With a one player team, cycling through undoes the effect \n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hehe.  &quot;Tic and Tac&quot; is the hardest level by far in my book.  It&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; because the experience levels of those opponents are so high.\n&gt; \n&gt; This level is pretty easy so long as you make the elves fight \n&gt; Jakarta&#39;s men.  If you try to brute force it, it&#39;s a real meat \n&gt; grinder.  I suppose with a large army you can&#39;t control your men \nwell \n&gt; enough to hold back, though.\n\nA small army can barely surive.  I beat that scenario with a large \narmy when the minor miracle of my entire team acting like a team \noccurred; most of the time, they acted like it&#39;s every character for \nhimself/herself.\n \n&gt; &gt; At least now you can download a version of Gladiator:Beyond \n&gt; Freedom.  \n&gt; &gt; visit http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gladiator/files/Alpa/ to \n&gt; download \n&gt; &gt; the files for that program.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the same alpha that&#39;s been around on the FSGames site for a \n&gt; while, right?  I remember finding it unplayable -- doesn&#39;t it run \n&gt; super fast or something?\n\nThe G:BF version on FSGames has not been downloadable since I&#39;ve been \naround.  The guy who uploaded it claims it works.\n   \n&gt; &gt; No.  We had a pretty good discussion a while back about adding new \n&gt; &gt; abilites to characters and expanding character classes.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s too bad.\n\nI am going to get around to recycling that discussion sometime next \nyear.  I am going to work out a schedule for discussion to keep this \ngroup fairly active.\n   \n&gt; &gt; I would recommend to try the tevfifty first.  After that, \n&gt; &gt; try mine (dph&#39;s scenarios).\n&gt; \n&gt; Do these start on Level 1, or are they &quot;play after you beat the \n&gt; game&quot; -- by level 1 I mean troops @ level 1, not scenario 1.\n\n1)The tevify supposedly is.  \n\n2)My scenarios (dph&#39;s scenarios) aren&#39;t.  If you are going through my \nscenarios, you need to make sure your team has been through all \nbuilt-in scenarios and the tevifty.  Otherwise, you&#39;re going to run \ninto trouble by opponents have high experience levels.  Others have \nclaimed they can&#39;t beat one of my scenarios without a character \nbecoming an experience level higher after beating a scenario.  It&#39;s \npretty scary how high the experience levels of my team are after being \n through the built-in scenarios, the tevfifty, and my own.  I still \ngotta complete the set of 50 and I am concerned about crashing the \ngame by ending up with a character who has too high an experience \nlevel.\n\nThe 50 Project is about creating 50 brand new scenarios as a group to \nstart with a brand-new team.  Basic plotline has been developed by me. \n I just gotta work on breaking the individual stories for every \nscenario.  If the 50 project proves fairly successfull, I have a \nfollow-up ready.\n  \n&gt; &gt; We&#39;re also working on getting a gladiator tournament ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; ?  How would that work?\n\nOffline by sending your saved game files in.  We have established \nbasic rules (somebody remind me to put them in a file in the file \nsection).\n \n&gt; How many people still subscribe to this list, btw?\n\n64.\n\n\n"}}
