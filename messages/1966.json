It&#39;s getting fun to have a team full of characters who \nare experience level 343 (except for the slime).  I estimate I&#39;m about \n1/4 of the way to the point of maxing out experience points for the \ncharacters.\n\nOf course, I&#39;m getting concerned abotu one thing.  It appears that the \ncon stat has more affect on health than the armor stat or it could be \nbecause the strength level is so high that the cons stat would have \nmore impact than it normally would on health.\n\n\n"}}
