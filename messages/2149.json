I bought the full version for $10 from a store, but didn&#39;t\nregister. Would registering have given me access to more scenarios or\nsomething like that? If it does, how can I get those scenarios now?\n\nA registered version gives you access to use scenarios created by\nvarious people such as Telvido and myself.\n\n&gt; 2. Is the ultimate goal of the game to beat Jakara (or whatever his\nname is)? Something that really bothers me about this game is it never\nsays &quot;The end&quot; or &quot;Congratulations, you win!&quot; or anything... there\njust aren&#39;t any more opponents on the levels anymore.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game?  Hmm.  In my set, the ultimate goal is\ntake out Subian, an archmage who has very high experience level.  [Of\ncourse, I&#39;ve wondered if, when I revised my scenarios, I didn&#39;t make\nit too easy.  Oh well, there&#39;s a really powerfull slime to make up for\nit.]\n\n&gt; 3. Why are there golems and giant skeletons programmed in the game\nif they never show up in any ordinary scenarios?\n\nBecause we can use them.  I&#39;ve used Giant Skeletons and Golems and so\nhas Telvido in his set.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
