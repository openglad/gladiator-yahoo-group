This list has finally surpassed having 2000 messages posted.\n\n2nd, anybody know exactly what causes slime to stop splitting on their own?  Ok, I was doing some experiments with slime, while \nkeeping time frozen and never let my number of characters get above 100.  When I got close to 99 the first time, I start doing \nslaughtering to bring the number way down.  Then I start letting the number of slime go up and they stopped splitting on their own, \neven though the number of characters at that point had not exceeded 100.  Anybody got any ideas?  I know it wasn&#39;t a matter of mana \nI gave them excess mana to let them multiply on their own.\n\n3rd, I want to wish everybody Happy Holidays.\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------\nYahoo!
