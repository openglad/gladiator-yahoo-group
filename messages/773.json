A huge\ndilemma for me in playing a game on &#39;battle&#39; difficulty or above is\nthat if I leave my team to fend for itself, it usually results in the team\nbeing crushed while the character I control lives and makes semi-\nintelligent decisions.\n\n--- story about my woes in certain levels  ---\nIn fact, I can often do better if I make the\ngame two player and use the off-player to repeatedly call my guys\nback into position while I accomplish some important tasks with\na single other character.  For example, in the first skeleton level\n(where the standard game really starts to get a sharp curve in\ndifficulty, unless you&#39;re on skirmish), the tents create fairly strong\nskeletons.  A successful run for me usually involves sending a\nwarrior or thief quickly forward to bust up the tents then regroup.\nUsually if I do this I end up returning to a dead team that wandered\nout of the safe spot (between trees and water) that I was trying to\nkeep them in.\n--- /story ---\n\nI&#39;d propose being able to toggle an attack stance on characters.\nStandstill / defensive / aggressive -- this would allow you to quickly\ndecide whether your team should run away from danger or stay in\none strategic spot.  Sometimes, as mentioned above, I have to\ndeliver an inordinate amount of attention to my team of &#39;reserves&#39;\nin order to keep them in a strategically sound place.\n\nAlso, I&#39;d propose non-player controlled characters to -not- switch\naround their spell; they would use the same spell or skill that the\nplayer left them using.  I&#39;d also add a &#39;none&#39; switch, so I could keep\nmy guys from using skills at all when I&#39;m not controlling them.  This\nwould keep thieves from bombing themselves to death, mages from\nteleporting into extreme danger, and clerics from trying to raise\nundead when they should be using all they can to heal their team in\nthe midst of a heated battle.\n\nSo yeah.\n\nThese seem like simple enough changes to me; if there were to be\nanother update to the original gladiator game, even, these would\nbe excellent changes.  It would give a player much greater control\nover his team.\n\nShayd/Chris\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: dancing corpse &lt;dancing_corpse@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, July 03, 2001 1:56 AM\nSubject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 4\n\n\n&gt; i don&#39;t think we should add formation because that would make it too much\n&gt; like aok or other war games (only we can&#39;t build things in mid game) on\nthe\n&gt; other hand we could make a charecter who&#39;s special&#39;s make the entire groop\n&gt; get in formation. Like Field Marshal below:\n&gt; normal attack&#39;s like solder\n&gt;\n&gt; (every one has a reverse that reseases men or you just need to press &quot;yo&quot;\nto\n&gt; resease them, it doesn&#39;t matter to me)\n&gt; attack 1 call aid: like &quot;YO&quot; only much more affectave: calls everyone who\n&gt; can get to you and isn&#39;t otherwise engaged to all attack the person you&#39;re\n&gt; attacking, they continue attacking people with you depending on how much\n&gt; magic you used\n&gt;\n&gt; attack 2 block: create&#39;s a block formation which act&#39;s as one unit in\nmoving\n&gt; ect and only break&#39;s up if it attack&#39;s in hand to hand attack as everyone\n&gt; rushes on the enemy. when using special&#39;s cycles through all level 1\n&gt; special&#39;s  of everyone in the groop using cycling button\n&gt; (no level 4+ special&#39;s cuz those would complicate things too much) and\n&gt; everyone in the the groop who has that special would use it. the reverce\n&gt; would be for everyone who doesn&#39;t need permision to use there special&#39;s\n&gt; simultaniously.\n&gt; attack 3 pincer: like block only when they attack in hand it hand the\ndevide\n&gt; up into 3 groups (2 fast groops one slow one) and come at the enemy from\nall\n&gt; sides.\n&gt; attack 4 formations: go into your choice of 3 formations: arrow head,\n&gt; defensive, scattered (or something)\n&gt;\n&gt; he might need to be a bit weeker then a solder to gain more levels\n&gt;\n&gt; _,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n&gt; ���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n&gt; -Terry\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 4\n&gt; Date: Mon, 02 Jul 2001 17:23:51 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In gladiator@y..., &quot;dancing corpse&quot; &lt;dancing_corpse@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  &gt; we didn&#39;t get much talking in this subgect...\n&gt;\n&gt; I kept waiting for this topic to be picked up and replied to.  Since\n&gt; no person bothered to reply to it, I moved on.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was hoping for a rather large (and long) amount of discussion about\n&gt; features for Gladiator:Beyond Freedom.  You have to realize there is\n&gt; only so much you can do in Gladiator the way it is currently coded.\n&gt;\n&gt; Things like speeding up chain-lightning (as indicated by Tom Ricket)\n&gt; would require changing a lot of things.  Adding formation control to\n&gt; your team is another because the game would have to be changed from\n&gt; the inside to make it better suited for that type of thing.  Things\n&gt; like adding new characters and adding (most) new attacks won&#39;t require\n&gt; significantly changing the code.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
