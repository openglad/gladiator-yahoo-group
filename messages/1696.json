It&#39;s a three-team map - you, with a few of the towers as NPCs (they die fast), most of the towers on another team, and blue, with a level-100 mage and archmage who want very much to kill you, as well as an equal share of the towers as you.\n\nNeedless to say, this level was made for a single supercharacter.
