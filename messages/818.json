Most of my legitimate right now\nis almost to the point of having trouble with teleporters because of\nrunning too fast.  My legitimate archmage has lots of troubles with\nteleporters because he is above experience level 200.  I&#39;m telling you\nthat I&#39;m leaning towards a large army of experience level 50-75\ncharacters rather a team composed of one experience level 200+\ncharacter just because of teleporters.  You won&#39;t believe how fast you\ncan outrun your own attacks at that level and that makes using\nteleporters difficult.  I&#39;d like to redo teleporters to allow you to\npress a key on a teleporter just to teleport.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
