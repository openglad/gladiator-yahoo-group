If the enemy is concentrated in a\nparticular area at the beginning of a stage, and too\nfar away for you to use chain lightning on, mind\ncontrol is a good way to confuse them. They&#39;ll stop to\nfight with themselves instead of charging right for\nyou, allowing you to get to a defensible position.\nSome of the enemies might even be killed. After the\nfirst use, though, mind control is much less\neffective. I couldn&#39;t say why... it just controls\nfewer enemies each time. If there were limits on how\nmany enemies could be controlled, and the duration\nwere more stable, this could be a useful spell.\n\nChain lightning can be just brutal, if used correctly.\nGet the enemy to pile up against a wall or forest or\nwater, then let the crowd have it. Pow. I&#39;ve killed\nmore than half the enemies in a level with just one\nchain lightning on several occasions.\n\nSummon elemental needs to be downgraded--it&#39;s just too\npowerful!\n\nI&#39;d like to be able to see Magic Mace more easily,\nrather than just fuzziness floating around the screen.\nThe rest of the cleric abilities are fine as they are.\n   -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
