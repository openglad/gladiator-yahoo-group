If so, this is your week to discuss those ideas.\n\nI&#39;ll start with a brand one:\n\ngargoyle character class\nbasic attack - claw a character in front of it or tail whip a \ncharacter behind it\nspecial attacks\n1)glide - this allows the character to glide short distances over \ntrees and water (basic attack won&#39;t work while gliding for obvious \nreasons)\n2)hibernate - this allows the character to turn to stone for healing. \n During this process of healing, 95% of the damage from any attack on \nthe character is automatically deflected while mana is used to restore \nhealth.  Hibernation ends either after all mana is exhausted or the \ncharacter is in full health.\n\nIt&#39;s ok to disagree with the moderator.\n\n\n"}}
