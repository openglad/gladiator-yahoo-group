At least the ability to easily keep your group together w/ having to repeatedly call everyone back when they start to wander off.\n\nAs for only deploying a partial team; that kind of goes against the story where you&#39;re basically camping in the wilderness and end up in all these fights... hmm, mb not though, seeing as some of the scenarios are more intentional engagements, and seeing as you are able to add more troops between levels.  But maybe an ability to &quot;fortify&quot; some of your guys, so they stay in one spot, and maybe throw up some more protection would help; at least they wouldn&#39;t wander off and get killed.\n\n\nOn Wed, 5 Sep 2007, alternate_dph wrote:\n\n&gt; I&#39;m thinking it is a three-fold problem:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1)generating random maps\n&gt;\n&gt; 2)analyzing a player&#39;s team to determine appropriate computer opponents\n&gt;\n&gt; 3)placing said opponents on the map\n&gt;\n&gt; Problems #1 & 3 are sorta related.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hypothetically, one could build a program that reads in a map and\n&gt; randomly places characters on it in good position.  That solves\n&gt; problem #3.\n&gt;\n&gt; Problem #2 is tricky.  I think everybody can agree a computer\n&gt; character of experience level 2 is generally better than the exact\n&gt; same character hired by a player and given stats.  Figuring out an\n&gt; equitable comparison is going to be tricky.\n&gt;\n&gt; Admittedly, I haven&#39;t played the game in a while because, frankly,\n&gt; there is no challenge really left.  The only thing that would make the\n&gt; game challenging to me is improvements in the game itself, no\n&gt; necessarily new levels.\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the biggest improvements that would make the game more\n&gt; challenging to me is letting me buy a team of 12, but only put 1-6 on\n&gt; the field at a time.  The other one is better ai for the characters.\n&gt; In practical terms, you can only keep active control of 6 characters.\n&gt; The rest of the characters would have to be on their own.  Hey, that\n&gt; brings me another id.  Why not have the option of &quot;hands free&quot; mode?\n&gt; Simply put, have a way where you don&#39;t have to control anybody on your\n&gt; team, but you could watch.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
