While we&#39;re very \nhappy they&#39;re doing this (D2 looks like it will be a wonderful game!), this \nmeans that we as a group haven&#39;t had time to work on it, so it&#39;s sat sadly \nat the second alpha stage for many months now :(\n\nI&#39;ve had other reports that the link is broken, and I&#39;ll go try to fix \nthat.  I keep meaning to do this, and keep forgetting..\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
