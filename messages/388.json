They&#39;re not particularly fun to play, and they&#39;re all basically\n&gt;set on the first map, South of Talwood. I noticed that they&#39;re designed so\n&gt;only a mage or archmage would have a fighting chance of winning...\n&gt;\n&gt;I&#39;d like to propose a new trainable stat:\n&gt;&quot;Not-running-around-like-a-chicken-with-its-head-cut-off&quot;. Even with a\n&gt;zillion armor, nearby explosions tend to send my characters prancing all\n&gt;over the screen, running here and there and subsequently getting scared by\n&gt;ghosts. I mean, how shocked and bewildered is an archmage with several\n&gt;hundred intelligence going to be if a tower he was shooting at blows up?\n&gt;\n&gt;Still working on various little Gladiator projects... when they&#39;re done \n&gt;I&#39;ll\n&gt;post them to my Gladiator site. The Warcraft II stuff I&#39;ve been doing has\n&gt;been much quicker to see completion, so I&#39;d better create a page for that\n&gt;too. Anyone else out there do levels for Gladiator AND Warcraft? It&#39;s so\n&gt;much easier to create a storyline with Gladiator, but Warcraft has ships \n&gt;and\n&gt;some decent magic...\n&gt;_________________________________________________________________\n&gt;Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
