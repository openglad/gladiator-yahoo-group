Great game, currently taking my team through \nthe TevFifty, which btw is extremely well done.  \n  Just one major problem that needs to be fixed in future versions:  \nmy fire elemental is level 26 w/ dex of 250.  He&#39;s almost so fast \nthat he outruns his own fireballs, which will probably turn extremely \nannoying once he actually CAN outrun them.  That really should be \nfixed.  Physically, it&#39;s not even possible.\n\n--Michael\n\n\n"}}
