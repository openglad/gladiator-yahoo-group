While there is no way to &quot;prove&quot; to your dad that his \ncredit card transaction is secure, you can tell him that thousands of \npeople have purchased games from this site, and there hasn&#39;t been a single \nreported case of credit card fraud as a result.  Using a credit card to \npurchase products online is no more or less safe than using a credit card \nat your local software store, and is probably safer than using it over the \nphone to say, a mail order company.  If that doesn&#39;t work, you can probably \nsend a check or money order, but you&#39;d have to ask the guys at forgotten \nsages about that.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom:\tmatt starkey [SMTP:basicmatt@...]\nSent:\tTuesday, February 09, 1999 2:32 AM\nTo:\tgladiator@onelist.com\nSubject:\t[gladiator] Re: Welcome to gladiator@onelist.com\n\nFrom: &quot;matt starkey&quot; &lt;basicmatt@...&gt;\n\nHi!\n     How do I get the full version of Gladiator?
