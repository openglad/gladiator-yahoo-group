Just drop it.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was working on a set a while back, but... frankly, it&#39;s too difficult \n&gt;to\n&gt; &gt;use the editor effectively.. I mean, I&#39;d be fine if it were text-based or\n&gt; &gt;if it were a windows executable or if it had instructions or if it didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;crash all the time (well, on my one system, at any rate)...\n&gt;\n&gt;If you just send me what you have, I can finish. I find the Scen.exe to be\n&gt;very usable... and there ARE instructions. Or are you talking about\n&gt;Editor.exe? Now that one is a bit tricky, but there&#39;s no need to use it for\n&gt;making a whole level. Wait... what ARE you talking about?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;DAYOFDRA.MOD is probably a MODULE music file. Go to \n&gt;http://www.modplug.com\n&gt; &gt;and grab the modplug player. Open the dayofdra.mod in the player, and you\n&gt; &gt;should start hearing music (if it IS a mod file)\n&gt;\n&gt;DAYOFDRA.MOD was a file LISTED in levels.001, but I&#39;ve been unable to \n&gt;unpack\n&gt;it... it&#39;s apparently just some of the extraneous stuff that found its way\n&gt;there by accident, like the level 99 that gave all those people \n&gt;conniptions.\n&gt;\n&gt;C&#39;mon, folks, everyone was foaming at the mouths for a big compilation...\n&gt;let&#39;s see some files!\n&gt;                   -Tevildo.\n&gt;______________________________________________________\n&gt;Get Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
