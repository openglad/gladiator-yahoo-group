Mine was purchased THIS year.  I \nhave theories about keeping the game from crashing, though.  Doing \nthings like allocuting more memory to the game generally helps.\n\nLet me tell you a few things upfront that I learned:\n1) ALWAYS give plenty of space to walk around.  If you have any doubt \nabout space to walk around being too small, try sending a large slime \nor a fire elemental to walk through it.\n2) repeat number 1.\n3) if you are going to have super-powered characters, build up to that \npoint.  You don&#39;t start off against experience level 12 or higher.  I \nhave sent my 100% legitimate team through all built-in scenarios, all \nthe tevfifty, and then I was able to start against some opponents.  \nBut I have had to build my way up to strong opponents.\n4) time being frozen repeatedly isn&#39;t very fun.  Especially when there \nis a mage tower that can generate more mages that can freeze time.\n\n\n"}}
