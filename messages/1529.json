Don&#39;t worry: I have two other separate forms\n&gt; for choosing which characters and which treasures to put on the\n&gt; screen.  Coding the command button shouldn&#39;t be a problem since I plan\n&gt; on stealing some of my own code I developed earlier.  Creating the\n&gt; text validation might be tricky, though.  I&#39;m not too sure if giving\n&gt; the user the option of choosing the scenario type; I may redo that as\n&gt; a list box just to save time.\n\nVisual Basic isn&#39;t the most cross-platform thing in existance, but if it\nworks, it works. We can always rewrite it in C later for use across\nplatforms. It looks good, though. The outside isn&#39;t really important, its\nthe inside that matters.\n\nTerrain generation can also be incorporated into that later, but I think\nmost of us preffer coding in C than in VB. We&#39;ll get to that later,\nthough.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Picking the grid file and dimensions is going to be tricky, though.  I\n&gt; am tempted to make the user pick an existing map to use and make the\n&gt; program read the grid file to pull out the available dimensions.\n&gt;\n\nThat works. Speaking of grids, I wrote a pixedit program yesterday. It\ndoesn&#39;t actually edit pixes yet, but it views them. Its pixedit.c in the\nutils/ folder if you want to check it out. Latest in CVS works quite well.\nThis will also work for map grid files.\n\n&gt; Also, I&#39;m wondering about allowing the program to pick random levels\n&gt; for the different types of objects if the user supplies the range.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m also unsure of how to handle team numbers for the characters: Does\n&gt; each character get a randomly assigned team number; each character is\n&gt; on the same team as the user chooses; or the user chooses x number of\n&gt; random characters to be on team 1, x number of characters to be on\n&gt; team 2, etc?\n\nI think the best thing would be to have an option for the amount of enemy\nteams, then distribute foes randomly between them.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, what about player positions/exits?  I am going to assume the\n&gt; user will have to add an exit pointing to another scenario or should\n&gt; the user get the choice about putting in one exit to whatever scenario\n&gt; level?  Also, should the program assign initial player start-up\n&gt; positions?\n&gt;\n\nIf start-up positions arn&#39;t specified, the game will scatter your team all\nover the map randomly. If exits arn&#39;t specified, the only way to get out\nof the level is to abort.\n\n&gt; Also, here&#39;s a list of my assumptions:\n&gt; 1)if a teleporter is choosen at random, you would always get a pair of\n&gt; teleporters (one by itself is useless unless you want to torment the\n&gt; player)\n&gt; 2)if a door has x level and is on team y, then there is a key that has\n&gt; x level and is on team y.  The same is true in reverse with respect to\n&gt; keys and doors. - [That presents any interesting question about how to\n&gt; handle doors and keys]\n&gt; 3)this program will not have intelligence enough not to place a\n&gt; character and treasure in a &quot;bad&quot; location.  If somebody wants to add\n&gt; that feature later, no problems.\n&gt; 4)the user adds text later.\n\nThose are all reasonable assumptions and are easy to change in code.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; With the answers to these questions, I should have a program ready by\n&gt; September 13.\n\nCool. Do you want me to create a subproject for it on Sourceforge so that\nit&#39;ll be easily accessable from the sourceforge project page? That would\nalso take care of hosting and all that stuff.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
