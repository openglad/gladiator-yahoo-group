Meanwhile, \nI&#39;m putting together an unstoppable team, while refining my bonus \nscenario to yield just the right amount of cash.  The strength level \nof each member is determined by the point where the buying strength is \nfree. Aside from my slime, I&#39;m starting to see a pattern of where the \nstats are free for strength: around the number 25625.  \n(Hypothetically, aside from significant raising of funds, nobody \nshould be buying stats that are above 10,000.)  That&#39;s for archers, \ndruids, clerics, and fire elementals.  (Haven&#39;t gotten to the rest of \nthe characters yet.)\n\n\n\n\n"}}
