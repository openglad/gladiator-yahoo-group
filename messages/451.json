Great game, currently taking my team through \n&gt; the TevFifty, which btw is extremely well done.  \n\nGreat idea to take teams through the tevfifty before attempting to go \nthrough any scenarios I have created.\n\n&gt;   Just one major problem that needs to be fixed in future versions: \n \n&gt; my fire elemental is level 26 w/ dex of 250.  He&#39;s almost so fast \n&gt; that he outruns his own fireballs, which will probably turn \nextremely \n&gt; annoying once he actually CAN outrun them.  That really should be \n&gt; fixed.  Physically, it&#39;s not even possible.\n\nHehehe.  I&#39;ve had mages and archmages who could outrun their \nfireballs.  Recently, I created a soldier who could outrun his \nreturning knives.  That was quite a feat, considering how many knives \nhe had.  I think I had an archer who could outrun his arrows.\n\nAside from that, I have had characters who could outrun long-range \nattacks.  There are only two solutions:  speed up the weapons OR set \nmax limits for characters to run at.\n\n\n"}}
