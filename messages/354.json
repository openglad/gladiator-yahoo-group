I froze time in slaughter to keep him from summoning chain \nlightning.\n\nNow, since the tevfifty has a scenario where the mages want to warp \nspace and I have a scenario where friendly archmages like to summon \nchain-lightning, are there any requests for knowing how to make a \ncertain character do a certain thing?\n\n\n"}}
