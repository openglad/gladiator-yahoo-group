I&#39;m back... it&#39;s been real wacky out my way for about the past \ntwo months. I&#39;ve changed colleges (now I&#39;m at a place where I have \nreal influence and people are cool) and swapped through half a dozen \njobs... People have been loading all sorts of RPGs on me to see how \ngood I really am, and the main game I&#39;m involved in (Two Towers, \nwww.angband.com/towers) has had a lot of political upheaval. \nYesterday my girlfriend sent me a nasty email saying that we&#39;re \nthrough... and an old friend of mine has had to move into my place \nfor legal reasons. Like I said, it&#39;s been wacky. But now that my \nsister&#39;s wedding and all that other nonsense is taken care of I \nshould be able to pay more attention to this stuff. Can anyone sum up \nexactly what is going on, and what is desired from me? I&#39;m certainly \nopen for scenario design and plot outlining. The coding is outside my \nexpertise. Gotta slide...\n     -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n\n"}}
