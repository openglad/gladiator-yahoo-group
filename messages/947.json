It does run (at insanely \nhigh\n&gt; speed, go P600...) and has at least 1 or 2 levels buried in it.\n&gt; The file is ~17MB, and I don&#39;t know if the above link still works - \nI still\n&gt; have it, and DPH is right, the yahoo groups file storage has (just) \nenough\n&gt; space to hold it.\n&gt; \n&gt; However there is one minor problem - the software is actually owned \nby the\n&gt; Forgotten Sages, and thus you&#39;ll probably find that the copy we have\n&gt; actually falls under the &#39;warez&#39; category and so it&#39;s likely to be\n&gt; prohibited by Yahoo :)\n&gt; To get around that we simply need someone from FS to tell us we can \nupload\n&gt; it, and maybe put a note somewhere in the groups online presence so \nYahoo\n&gt; doesn&#39;t go deleting it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ll try to upload it once FS gives us the go-ahead, \nhopefully my\n&gt; modem connection won&#39;t fall apart part way through it - does anyone \nknow if\n&gt; yahoo can resume transfers?\n&gt; \n&gt; - Deathifier\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@y...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;gladiator@y...&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 10, 2001 5:52 AM\n&gt; Subject: [gladiator] Re: Hey...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In gladiator@y..., &quot;Rory Wilde&quot; &lt;laughingmadman@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t Tom post the demo of G:BF somewhere before?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hehe.

The link on FS Games website has not worked and still\n&gt; &gt; does not work.  There is enough space in this group to upload all \nof\n&gt; &gt; Gladiator:Beyond Freedom in the files section.
