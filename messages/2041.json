All you would need is all the map \n&gt;tile pics in the same folder so that you could display the map like \n&gt;I have it.\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nSo, if you already have a script which converts a map to an html page, I \ndon&#39;t quite understand why you need a dynamic html page for it?  Why are \nstatic pages not sufficient? \n\n&gt;Until somebody comes along who understands more about graphics and \n&gt;how to merge pics together in a program, this is the closest thing \n&gt;we have to exporting maps for general view.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\nyou might be able to script something in the Gimp, but I don&#39;t know.  It \nmight also be of interest (and not all that difficult) to produce a \nminimap; just assign each tile piece a color, then write one pixel per \ntile.  The .bmp format is fairly straigt forward, and can be converted \nto a  format with compression with just about any image tool. \n\nBjorn\n\n"}}
