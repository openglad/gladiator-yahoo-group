Worse problem: there are 8 \n&gt; teams in the scenario and each one has a mage capable of slowing \ndown \n&gt; time.  How would that problem be handled?\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing to consider is making the time slow down delay before \n&gt; using it again effect the entire team.  What if team 1 had 3 \nmages?  \n&gt; Effectively, team 1 could rotate out who slows down time to keep \ntime \n&gt; indefinitely frozen.\n\nTo avoid the problem of 8 different teams with time slowdown ability, \nmaybe thay should ALL have it disabled for a few minutes after a \nslowdown.\n\n\n\n"}}
