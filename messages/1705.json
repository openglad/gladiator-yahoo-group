You&#39;re correct, though, in that it\nhasn&#39;t\n  been updated for a number of years now, although some nifty people at\n  SnowStorm made a new Win32 port of the game.  The original is still being\n  sold through Albert&#39;s Ambry\n  (http://www.alberts.com:8080/Ambry/Search?Type=KeyWord\n\n&lt;http://www.alberts.com:8080/Ambry/Search?Type=KeyWord&StartAfter=&maxHits=1\n  0&AndOr=all&OS=&SearchText=gladiator&gt;\n  &StartAfter=&maxHits=10&AndOr=all&OS=&SearchText=gladiator).\n\n  2)       G:BF pretty much got abandoned when the four main programmers had\n  to get real jobs and stop working on Gladiator all the time :-(  ... it&#39;s\n  kind of a pipe dream to get back together and work on it, but so far\n  Blizzard has kept us too busy.\n\n\n\n  --Tom\n\n\n\n  -----Original Message-----\n  From: Amir Touray [mailto:z0diac717@...]\n  Sent: Thursday, March 06, 2003 8:46 PM\n  To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n  Subject: [gladiator] New Poster: On Buying Gladiator\n\n\n\n  1)Can I still buy Glad?\n  The site hasn&#39;t been updated in years and I don&#39;t want\n  to send money to a collapsed company, no matter how\n  good the Glad demo was.\n\n  2)Is Glad: BF coming up ever? or is that just a dream?\n\n\n\n  [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n        Yahoo!
