Here&#39;s a trick my friend and I used to pull when we were new\nto Gladiator and playing with the shareware version.\n\nWe&#39;d go to the slime level (the first one) and fence off  breeding\nareas with a druid (usually we only had two players, and one of us\nwas the druid -- if you have more controlled by the computer, they\nget dumb).  The slimes would multiply and give us something to kill,\nthough it was a slow process.  This is more reminiscence for me\nthan a real tip for people.\n\nWhat else?  Sending numerous sprites after a difficult enemy, then\npulling a cleric through to sweep the blood spots up and make\nsome undead.  This is a druid and cleric thing, and my favorite\nclass is thief, so it doesn&#39;t happen often.\n\nThere&#39;s always the &quot;leaving their bases intact to produce more\nenemies...&quot; but if the level is difficult enough for you to make any\nmajor gain off this it might be necessary to go for the bases early\non, before you overwhelm yourself.  Flying potions are another\nway to injure yourself (walk on water), and thieves can really\nscrew themselves up with their own explosives. :)\n\n-Chris/Shayd\n\n\n"}}
