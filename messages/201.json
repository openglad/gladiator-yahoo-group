My levels go from 350 to 399. I played them back, and most \nof them aren&#39;t as difficult as I intended, so I suggest people try them on \nthe more difficult settings. The killer levels will be hard on any setting.\n\nSorry about the mix-up, Light. If you want, I could link into your levels \nfrom my Garden of Golden Apples and connect them all. I originally intended \nto have my scenarios branch off of level 12 registered, but the original \nwould always overwrite my version. Strangely enough, the modified map came \nup just fine... but the .FSS file didn&#39;t work. I would have had an exit into \nTryxian Chronicles, but I think those levels are of poor quality.\n\nAs far as new abilities go, I think ghosts deserve a new power--maybe \n&quot;Haunt&quot;, to have it focus on a particular location or enemy. Giant skeletons \nand golems are unbalanced characters, so they should have special attacks \nfor close range. Maybe &quot;Squash&quot; for golems, and &quot;Chew and swallow enemy&quot; or \n&quot;Stomp&quot; for giant skeletons. Fire elementals should have an attack for \nsingle foes... &quot;Ignite&quot; as a lasting heartburst-like effect would kick. \nUnfortunately, it seems that Forgotten Sages won&#39;t be doing any coding \nanytime soon. Oh well...\n         -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
