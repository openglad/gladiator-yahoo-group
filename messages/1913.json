Where you can be one class and keep \ngaining levels / etc by doing various quests and killing monsters. \nYou would be able to gain items, gold, weapons/armor, spells, \ntechniques, etc.. and be able to play with your friends online!\n- Note: I have more ideas XD\n- Note: If it becomes an MMORPG, I might be able to help on the \ngraphics (monsters, weapons, etc). Maybe the music composition too!\n\n\n\n"}}
