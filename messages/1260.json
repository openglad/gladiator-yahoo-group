Lay a teleport marker a good distance away \nfrom the battle.  Then wait until your mana is recharged and start \nsummoning fire elementals.  The problem is a single archmage can \nsummon hundreds of fire elementals.  Talk about the balance of power \nfavoring an archmage.  If it wasn&#39;t for faeries being an achilles \nheal, archmages would be invincible in all situations.\n\nChain lightning - if implemented properly - would rock.  But chain \nlightning shouldn&#39;t be used against more than 20 opponents until it \nis revised unless you want your computer to freeze over.  I&#39;ve tried \nincreasing memory allocation to gladiator, shutting down as many \nprograms as possible, and slowing down/speeding up the game to improve \nthe performance of chain lightning.  If someone knows of any way that \nimproves the performance of chain lightning, EMAIL THE GROUP.\n\nI do invite people to go through my set and try out scenario 162.  \nWhy?  It&#39;s an archmage vs a cleric as long as you can keep your own \nteam out of the battle for their own good.\n\nI believe a fully powered cleric as dangerous as a fully powered \narchmage except for one thing: the cleric would rather attack than \nraise the undead.  The archmage would quickly summon fire elementals.\n\n\n"}}
