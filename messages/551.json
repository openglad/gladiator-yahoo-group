Part 3 will be about suggested new \ncharacters.  Part 4 wil be about features for Gladiator:Beyond \nFreedom.\n\nWhy bother?  In the off chance that the gladiator folks get back \ntogether and start to work on Gladiator.\n\nI will start with a couple of points:\n\n1)when all the opponents are defeated and all enemy generators are \ndestroyed, all characters SHOULD stop using any attacks.\n\n2)your teammates should be, when they reach a certain experience \nlevel, smart enough to destroy enemy trees that are blocking their \npath.\n\n\n"}}
