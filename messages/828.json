If a set of rules gets a super \nmajority vote of affirmation, that set of rules will become part of \nthe tournament rules.  Anything else will prevent the set of rules \nfrom being adopted.  The adoption process is about making sure the \ngladiator tournament group did not go overboard in making rules too \nstrict.\n\nVoting will be done by posting a message to this group.  If you can \nnot post messages from this site, send an email to \ngladiator@yahoogroups.com to vote.  No discussion of the rules will be \nallowed (or tolerated) during the voting.  The email should only \ncontain a message about voting for or against a set of rules.  \nViolators of this rule about no discussion of rules will find their \npotential messages to this group . . . filtered out to prevent any \ndiscussion of rules after breaking that rule once.  If you feel the \nneed to discuss the rules for the tournament, join the gladiator \ntournament group (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glad-tourny).  This is \nthe only time (in the forseeable future) that I am going to walk \naround with my stick in plain view looking to use it.\n\nI am posting this message as a warning for what I expect when we start \nthe adoption of rules.  When I post the message about adopting the \nrules, I will repeat the warnings.\n\n\n"}}
