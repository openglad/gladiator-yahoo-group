I had a level \n568 archmage.  Thankfully, I forgot to save the game when I ran over \ntoo much magic power, and I brought the archmage back.  This time, I \ndid not raise the intelligence any (I rounded up to the next 100) and \nI did not have an archmage with too much magic power.  All was going \nwell because I could do any attack without running out of magic power \n(for some reason, the game waits a few seconds before letting you \nsummon another image or fire elemental).  Is there any way of getting \nthe game up running again without installing it into another folder?\n\nThe good news (if that could be considered good news) is that I found \nsome limits and it will improbable (not impossible) to get a \nlegitimate team up to that point.  However, I refuse to disclose the \ndetails of the scenarios that I used to bring my level 256 archmage to \nlevel 500+, except to say that a single character (other than \narchmage) can not handle those scenarios.\n\nA while back, some was commenting that rocks thrown by elves are not \nvery good.  Let me explain something that I learned.  Rocks thrown by \nlevel 3000+ elves have a tendacy to never go away.  When you consider \nthe potency of those rocks, you realize that an army of summoned fire \nelementals does not have a snowball&#39;s chance in the rainforest against \nsuch opponents.\n\nThat said, I believe Tents are the most efficient way to raise an army \nof so called &#39;gods&#39;.  Even if your summoned fire elementals do not \nhave a prayer, all you need is the fire elemental to last long enough \nto take out a tent.\n\n\n"}}
