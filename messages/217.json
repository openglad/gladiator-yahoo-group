I have played 3 to\n4\n  of the scenarios.  Sheesh, Was the person maze hungry he/she\ndesigned\nthem?\n\nI am also getting familiar with the Scenario editor.  When I refer to\n&#39;normal&#39; trees, I mean trees that nobody can destory, you know the\nbig, tall trees (not short druid-created trees).  If you can put the\nbig, tall trees on the map, tell me how.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
