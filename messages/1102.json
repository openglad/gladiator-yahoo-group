Once \n&gt; you get it as a cleric, stages become farcical, and your level sky-\n&gt; rockets.\n\nThat&#39;s why I view exp level 1-2 opponents as future team mates.\n\n&gt; 2) Is there any point to whirl and disasrm?  There is a \n&gt; (questionable) value to boomerang, once you have a ton of MP, but \n&gt; charge is clearly the best soldier ability.\n\nI actually view soldiers as magic guzzlers because the amount of \ndamage done compared to the amount of magic used is ridiculous.\n \n&gt; 3) Do resurrect and eat corpse even work?\n\nEat corpse supposedly works.  Resurrect works.\n \n&gt; 4) Are ghosts as ludicrously powerful in &quot;army v. army&quot; style play \nas \n&gt; they are in &quot;heroes v. army&quot;?  As it currently stands, if a ghost \n&gt; catches one of us in a corner, it&#39;s just escape, restart, because \n&gt; there&#39;s no hope of ever getting unscared.  Seems foolish, so I can&#39;t \n&gt; imagine it&#39;s that way if you play &quot;properly.&quot;\n\nActually, the same solution exists to this problem as the problem of \nstanding next to a bomb when it explodes.  Cycle through your \nteammates, because by the time you get back to yourself you&#39;re \nunfrozen.  With a one player team, cycling through undoes the effect \nimmediately, most of the time.\n \n&gt; 5) Anyone noticed that if you lose a level, leave it, and come back \n&gt; much later, it will be beaten?\n\nSometimes.\n \n&gt; 6) Why is Centweith Manor so difficult relative to every other level \n&gt; in the game, when it&#39;s ostensibly a &quot;side-quest&quot; on your way to \n&gt; killing Jakarta?  Am I missing something about how you&#39;re supposed \nto play it?\n\nHehe.  &quot;Tic and Tac&quot; is the hardest level by far in my book.  It&#39;s \nbecause the experience levels of those opponents are so high.\n \n&gt; 7) What exactly do the various stats do?  Especially dexterity, \nwhich \n&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to change walking speed very much; the others have \n&gt; their &quot;obvious&quot; effects -- more MP, more HP, less damage taken, more \n&gt; damage inflicted -- but does intelligence effect spells?  Etc.\n\nIntelligence effects amount of magic storied and how long it takes to \nrecharge your magic power.  Byeond that, I don&#39;t know.\n \n&gt; 8) Why are elvish rock-throwing attacks so damned powerful in \ncertain levels?\n\nI&#39;ve noticed that sometimes rocks can bounce around seeminglyt \nforever.\n \n&gt; ---\n \n&gt; Anyway, my larger questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Is Gladiator still being updated in any fashion?\n\nAt least now you can download a version of Gladiator:Beyond Freedom.  \nvisit http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gladiator/files/Alpa/ to download \nthe files for that program.\n \n&gt; 2) Is there any way to patch the game to add new classes, or to make \n&gt; the classes more interesting?  Right now, the Mage is really the \nonly one who gets increasingly complex as you level up.\n\nNo.  We had a pretty good discussion a while back about adding new \nabilites to characters and expanding character classes.\n \n&gt; 3) Are there any GOOD fan-made scenarios?  I didn&#39;t like Tryx \nmuch...\n\nVisit http://groups.yahoo.com/group/gladiator/files/Scenarios/ and try \nthose out.  I would recommend to try the tevfifty first.  After that, \ntry mine (dph&#39;s scenarios).\n\nWe&#39;re also working on getting a gladiator tournament ready.\n\n\n"}}
