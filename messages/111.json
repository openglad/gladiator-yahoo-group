Is everyone else on vacation or something?  I started \n&gt;to wonder where everyone is when I didn&#39;t get any more E-mail messages \n&gt;from onelist.  I&#39;m working on some maps for that Gladiator Arena or \n&gt;Colosseum or whatever it will be called. I have three maps already, but I \n&gt;am working on some more before I send them in.\n\n*smile* I wish I was on vacation! :) Actually, I&#39;ve been busy with \nnon-Gladiator stuff recently, so I haven&#39;t posted to the list. But, &quot;Hi!&quot; :)\n\nNot much to say .. I&#39;ll try to come up with something useful for my next note!\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
