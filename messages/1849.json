Of \ncourse, there is a cache of invulnerability potions under the tent in \nthe lower left hand corer.\n\nI think that illustrates a point.  In the &quot;Slime Lord&quot;, if you use \n&quot;F8&quot;, &quot;+&quot;, and delete keys to control the single slime, the game \ncrashes and the slime is level 128.  However, it&#39;s no big deal to \ncontrol &quot;Subian&quot; even though Subian&#39;s stats are higher in the 1st one.\n\nRedoing the diagonal hedges is a dreaded project.  I might be able to \nrebuild it from stratch faster than manually readjusting things.\n\nMy team composed of a fire elemental, barbarian, elf, and 2 clerics \ndidn&#39;t have that much trouble.\n\nMy current team composed of a thief, archer, druid, elf, and 2 clerics \nis having trouble though.\n\nYes, you understand why I put so much gold and silver in each \nscenario.  Literally, the money is going to build up your team.\n\nI had to cheat with health just to beat &quot;Hedge Free&quot; (#122).  Once I \ntook out &quot;Planter&quot;, it was no big deal to win, because my clerics \ncould just summon skeletons galore. [That bothers me about how easy \nthat makes any scenario.  If you can just surive long enough to start \nsummoning skeletons, you can win any scenario.]\n\n&quot;Yet Even More Hedges&quot; (#121) [Side note: that maze wasn&#39;t copied from \nanything else; strictly created in my head] can&#39;t be beat by a single \ncharacter without cheating unless the character is a thief who stays \ncloaked.  Forget using any mages or archmages in that scenario unless \nyou keep them permantly invisible.  As long as clerics summon \nskeletons to serve as distractions for the faeries, it&#39;s ok.  At one \npoint, there were almost 200 opponents in &quot;Yet Even More Hedges&quot; when \nI was walking through (only 58 level 12 druids were put in the \nscenario).  A mob of faeries and a nearby druid can take down any \ncharacter.  Seriously, let this be a lesson: a maze using trees as \nwalls with druids that can summon faeries is a very bad idea.  I do \nhave one question, though.  If your team went through the maze as a \nwhole as opposed to using a single character, would it be an easier?\n\n* * *\n\nBTW, I want to raise the stakes in the Monthly Scenario Contest.  I&#39;d \nlike to include the winner&#39;s scenario (if I&#39;m the winner, it&#39;s 2nd \nplace) in the new set of scenarios I&#39;m working on.  I already have a \nscenario in my head &quot;The Chamber of Time&quot; where the God of War can go \nto relive famous battles.  The scenario would be full of exits to \nother scenarios.  That&#39;s one of my paths.  My question is where else \ndoes a God of War go to hang out?  BTW, what kind of character suits a \ngod of war?  [Mages/Archmages need not attempt this position.]  [Don&#39;t \nworry; he&#39;s going to show up in about the same manner as Sun Bai did, \nexcept having not so innocent backstory.]\n\n\n"}}
