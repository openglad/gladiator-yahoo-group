That&#39;s become problematic.  Everyday,\nthis group recieves=\r\n quite a few pieces of spam coming from\nnon-members, and frankly I don&#39;t ha=\r\nve the time or inclination to track\ndown where the spam is originating from=\r\n.  Deleting spam won&#39;t be a\nproblem except every 2-3 days, it&#39;s 12 pending =\r\nmessages that are spam\nwaiting to be deleted.  I know yahoo groups has a se=\r\ntting where\npending messages are automatically deleted within some days if =\r\nthey\naren&#39;t touched.  My original intent in letting non-members post was to=\r\n\nremove obstacles for conversation.  At this point, I think it&#39;s too\nmuch t=\r\nrouble to allow non-members to be able to post so I am changing\nsettings ba=\r\nck where only members can post.\n\nIn other news, it&#39;s going to be a long whi=\r\nle before I get back to work\non my own scenario editor, unless a multitude =\r\nof feedback shows up. \nWhy?  I am working on revamping a website to run off=\r\n mysql and php. \nRight now, I&#39;m guessing I have over 200 pages of data entr=\r\ny commands\n(and growing) (I&#39;m in the middle of fixing some things so I can&#39;=\r\nt\nexactly put all the data entry commands in a single file; last time it\nwa=\r\ns in a single file - it was 168 pages of data entry commands.).\n\n\n\n\n"}}
