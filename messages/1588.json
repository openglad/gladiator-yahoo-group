A bunch of people\ncreated a group called Snowstorm Entertainment and started up a project to\nmake a clone of Gladiator. Someone found the project, posted it here,\nthen Tom Ricket saw it and open sourced Gladiator. Snowstorm changed their\ngoal from cloning to porting the old Gladiator to modern operating\nsystems, and Openglad was born.\n\nOpenglad runs on 5 OS&#39;es (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, BeOS, and Windows) and\ncurrently features slightly better graphics (on everything but BeOS) and\nbetter joystick handling (at least under Linux) than the original. Work is\ncurrently underway for a modern graphic format, resolution options, and\nclass scripting. We&#39;ll get to other things later, too.\n\nBjorn already posted the site URL, so go check it out. Its pretty cool :-)\n\n- Zardus\n\n\nOn Wed, 6 Nov 2002, shigtree wrote:\n\n&gt; I was just browsing the web-site (long time registered member), and\n&gt; for fun&lt; I wanted to see if the yahoo group still existed, and yay,\n&gt; apparently it does.
