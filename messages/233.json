I will send my slightly \nillegitimate team through next, and lastly start to send a 100% \nlegitimate team through every scenario.]  A couple of problems I \nnoticed, though.\n\nOne early scenario ended as soon as I defeated the last villain and I \ndid not get a chance to clean up on the gold and silver.\n\nThe forest was a little tight for my archmage to walk through (I had \nto summon an image of an elf to help me out), but that was probably \nthe point.\n\nMan, I love the extra large space to walk around for each scenario.  \nIf my archmage could not run so fast, it would make the some\nscenarios \nwith generators interesting.\n\nI can not wait to go through more of the scenarios.\n\n\n"}}
