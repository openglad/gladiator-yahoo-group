I know the password. I&#39;m askin \n&gt;for levels!! geeeeeeeeeezzzzzzzzzzz.........................\n\nI&#39;m not sure how, but the initial reply from Seth had a line quoted asking\nfor the password (the original message didn&#39;t show up for me) .. I&#39;m not\nsure if was in a message that I missed, or simply something that got\nconfused in the list.\n\nIn any case -- anyone who has lost their password, simple mail me (at\ntricket@...), and yes, I&#39;ll be happy to get you a new one once I\nverify your information.\n\nIn terms of levels -- anyone who&#39;s interested, just hang out on this list\nfor another week or so. One of the other list members volunteered to do\nwhat I&#39;ve been too lazy to do myself: take a number of levels that have\nsubmitted, and make a coherent package available :) It&#39;s a time-consuming\ntask, so give him a bit more time, but I&#39;m sure he&#39;s still working on it :&gt;\n\nRegarding the $800 Gladiator 5D game .. yes, that&#39;s not the real cost; the\nreal game is $899.95, with a $50 rebate for Gladiator 3 users ;-&gt;  (in\nother words -- the person who wrote the first note was joking).\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
