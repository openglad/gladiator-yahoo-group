I&#39;m hoping that we&#39;ll be ready by the 1st week of January \nfor the tournament.\n\nI would, also, for the record, state that I, as a moderator, receive a \nsmall email message alerting me everytime someone uploads a file to \nthis group and I bet I&#39;ll receive one every time a picture is uploaded \ninto the Photos section.  I&#39;m calling for using that space for screen \nshots of scenarios.  If I find anything that I consider inappropriate \nin the photos section, I will consider excercising some of my \nmoderator options.\n\n\n"}}
