I am a moderator of the Gladiator group, but I do not feel like \nreminding everyone all the time.\n\n2nd.  I have shut down access to the membership list to prevent \npotential harvesting of email addresses.  I have read about people \njoining yahoo groups just to harvest email addressess.  I would rather \nnot have done this, but I do want this community splintered over the \nissue of links.\n\n3rd.  I do not believe it is necessary to have a 1 million groups \ndedicated to a single subject unless each one offers something very \nunique from the other groups and there is enough interested people in \nthe subject.  Most of the time, IMHO, that&#39;s impossible.  I&#39;m also \nmaking it clear to the potential people working on a scenario editor \nthat if you establish your own group, I expect one of the \nqualifications of being a member of your group is membership in this \ngroup.  I have the same qualification for the tournament group.\n\n4th.  Frankly, I do not want to have to start moderatig posts.  For \nmost cases, I will issue a warning message.  If the problem occurs \nagain, moderation of posts will follow for a long time (more than 3 \nmonths).  If you have a problem with something, discuss it with me.  \nI&#39;m open-minded enough to hear your complaint out AND re-think it.  I \nalso will NOT start moderating posts of all new members unless a \nproblem starts showing up.\n\n5th.  On the issue of links, I will make this clear: I need to be \ncontacted before allowing links.  If Tom Ricket gives consent, I need \nan email from him expressing consent BEFORE the link is posted; \notherwise the message gets deleted.  Expect a miniumum of 24 hour \nresponse before hearing about a request for a link to another group.  \nThe following is a list of things that will cause me to give an \nautomatic NO to the would-be group:\n  a)inability to access the archives of the group WITHOUT being a \n    member\n  b)all messages of the group are moderated [unless there is a very \n    good reason to do so]\n  c)I can&#39;t see a direct link between the group and the gladiator \n    group\n  d)the other group won&#39;t allow a link to this group.  I want an email \n    from the owner of the group [moderator is ok, but I will check the \n    group owner just to make sure] oking it AND I will check to be \n    sure the group owner/moderator is the group owner/a moderator.\n\n6th.  I will tolerate complaints but not personal attacks for \ndecisions made as a moderator.  If any person has a gripe about my \npolicy regarding links to other groups, email me privately.\n\nThis is the way it is until Seth Mitchell (the group owner) changes \nthings.\n\n\n"}}
