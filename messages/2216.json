I know spending more time with slimes \nand respawn creatur=\r\nes helps.  Character success shouldn&#39;t depend on \nwhether players spend tim=\r\ne expoliting the XP system.\n\nAny other factors? \n\nAlso, in multiplayer mode=\r\n, the most powerful team player gets an XP \nmomentum which the other player=\r\ns can&#39;t keep up with.  (not fun/fair)\n\nA simple way to stabilize XP buildup=\r\n would be to assign a cash and \nXP value for each level.  No XP or cash for=\r\n killing creatures. Cash \npickups around the level would still be fine.  Th=\r\nat way, level \ndesigners would know exactly how much XP, cash (and power) a=\r\n team \nhas before they start the next level!  Not to mention how much \neasi=\r\ner it will be to balance the class and XP system.\n\nI&#39;m not sure exactly how=\r\n the xp should be divided among the team.\nMaybe divide 2/3 of the XP evenly=\r\n among the surviving players, and \n1/3 of the XP evenly among the surviving=\r\n npc&#39;s.\n\nPool team cash normally.\nAn number representing fair share should =\r\nbe displayed on the cash \nallocation screen, but not enforced.\n\nfair_share =\r\n=3D total_cash_from_level / #_of_team_players;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing=\r\n List\n \nYahoo!
