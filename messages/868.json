It&#39;ll just have\nto go on my list, about #4 or 5, and right now the top 3 haven&#39;t gone\nanywhere for the last couple of weeks so it could be quite a while until I\nproduce something :)\n\n&gt; Another feature I would like to add to the wish list is a sort feature\n&gt; for saving the grid files.  It would put all objects that are similiar\n&gt; (for example, player 1 positions) all close together to make it easier\n&gt; to see where the possible player start positions are.  This would have\n&gt; to be done where the player positions stay in the same order they were\n&gt; before, but they would all be close together.\n\nIs this for the converter?\nI can write the operators needed to run the sorting algorithms over the\nobjects and sort them some way (I cheated and left out the overloads in the\nconverter) that could be either hard-coded, or with some work user\nspecified.\n\nIf it&#39;s for the final editor well I&#39;m not sure how the current gladiator\neditors work though it sounds like you can bring up a list of objects, and\nsome of those are not displayed graphically.\nIn the editor we build everything will be graphical, and we can always also\nhave the option of viewing the object list in a window.\n\nRegardless yes it can be sorted.  I don&#39;t think the game cares much about\nwhere objects are in the list, or if there can be speed gains from sorting\nthem a specific way (Tom?) so it should be ok.\n\nThats all from me,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
