Ok, here&#39;s the legend for the picture:\n\n1)large size circles with black dots in them are teleporters\n2)medium size circles are characters stored in the map, color\nindicates which team they belong to\n3)small circles are player start positions on the map, color indicates\nwhich team\n4)big squares represent doors, color indicating which team can pass\nthrough\n5)small squares represent trees, color indiciating which team can pass\nthrough\n6)diamons (yes, those are supposed to be diamonds) indicate generators\n(when I can find any easy way to fill the area inside them with a\ncolor, color will indicate which team they belong to)\n7)tall boxes represent some treasures: gold and silver bars, all the\nvarious potions, and drumstick (color indicates which type of object -\nI&#39;m sticking really close to the original object here)\n\n*scratches head to see if there is anything else worth mentioning*\n\nOh yea, jpg format produced a larger file size than gif plus it didn&#39;t\nlook as good imo so that&#39;s why I choose to display this image in gif.\n The original file size in BMP was 901 kb.\n\nOh yea, this thumbnail radar view is 1/16th the size of the real map.\n So if things look off-centered, I&#39;m going to blame some unavoidable\nrounding errors for figuring out exactly where things go on a map.\n\nI&#39;m looking for feedback on some of my choices I made for how to\nrepresent things (I varied a lot in some aspects from the original\nprogramming for handling different objects on the radar) and any\nsuggestions for making things better.\n\nOh well, I&#39;m off to figure out the most effective way to blood stains\non the map as well as keys and exits.  Did I mention putting something\nto mark where blood is on the map?\n\nWhen I get through with the Advanced Thumbnail function, I&#39;ll update\nJesse again.\n\n\n"}}
