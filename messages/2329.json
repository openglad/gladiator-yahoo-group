In the PIX files, the team color is defined as any\ncolor a=\r\nbove color index 247 (colors 248-255). Gladiator draws each\ngraphic pixel-b=\r\ny-pixel. When it attempts to draw a pixel with a color\n&gt;247, it will take t=\r\nhe team number and use it remap that pixel to the\nproper team color.\n\nOpeng=\r\nlad is pretty much a direct port and uses the same method. If you\nlook at t=\r\nhe Openglad source code, the walker.cpp source file draws a\nsingle characte=\r\nr to the screen at line 982 (continuing for about 50\nlines). You will notic=\r\ne that it calls video::walkputbuffer(). One of\nthe arguments is query_team_=\r\ncolor(). The walkputbuffer() function is\nlocated at video.cpp:723. The rele=\r\nvant team color line is:          \nif(curcolor &gt; (unsigned char) 247)\n     =\r\n               curcolor =3D (unsigned char) (teamcolor+(255-curcolor));\n\nOp=\r\nenglad-e uses a little different method. In order to effectively use\nOpenGL=\r\n, I can&#39;t draw images pixel-by-pixel. So I handle the team\ncolors when I lo=\r\nad the image. On loading, I traverse the image\npixel-by-pixel and will repl=\r\nace each generic team color with the\ncorrect color according to the team of=\r\n the character I am loading the\nimage for.\n\n2)\nThe character walk code is h=\r\nandled in walker::walkstep(). It is\nessentially an switch statement that ch=\r\nanges the walk amount according\nto which direction it is facing.\n\nThe pixie=\r\nn class (parent of walker) handles the current animation\nframe in set_frame=\r\n(). set_frame() will update the bmp pointer to point\nto the correct frame. =\r\nWalker will then call set_frame whenever it\nneeds a new frame such as when =\r\nthe user changes directions or does the\nwalk animation.\n\n3)\nJava is not ver=\r\ny good in handling binary data :( I recently had to \nprocess fairly complic=\r\nated binary files in Java for my research lab. I\nwrote an object that exten=\r\nded ByteArrayInputStream and added methods\nlike readUInt32, readSInt16, rea=\r\ndNullTerminatedString(), etc that let\nme grab all the data I needed easily.=\r\n Those functions all read the\nbyte array a single byte at a time, but at le=\r\nast that was all abstracted. \n\nSean\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alt=\r\nernate_dph&quot; &lt;alternate_dph@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; There are a couple of issues I r=\r\nan into.  \n&gt; \n&gt; 1)I couldn&#39;t find the code in the code where it changes a c=\r\nharacter&#39;s\n&gt; color to match a specific team.  That&#39;s a very big issue.  If =\r\nI have\n&gt; the image in a certain way to be able to change color of the\n&gt; cha=\r\nracter, . . that can get real fun.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)I can&#39;t seem to find the code tha=\r\nt lets a character walk in any\n&gt; direction.  Without that, I&#39;m at a little =\r\nloss.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3)I ran into a constant problem of reading strings from binary f=\r\niles\n&gt; from Java.  Problem is there is no symmetry in the commands. \n&gt; Lite=\r\nrally, Java has one command to write strings to binary files, but\n&gt; the onl=\r\ny way to read strings in is 1 character at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In gladiator@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;Sean Ford&quot; &lt;aglswapbuffers@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I solved that p=\r\nroblem all ready :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I wrote a C utility that converts PIX files to=\r\n targa (TGA) graphic\n&gt; &gt; files. You can use any graphics program to convert=\r\n the tga files to\n&gt; &gt; just about any other format.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you are inte=\r\nrested in it, its located in the Openglad-e SVN\n&gt; &gt; repository. SVN instruc=\r\ntions can be found at:  \n&gt; &gt; http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=3D50083\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The C program is located in openglad-e/trunk/util/convert.c. All th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; targa graphics are located in openglad-e/trunk/pix. Note though that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; all the graphics have an extra row of pixels at the top. We were going\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; to use this row to store frame data for the animations (such as the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n number of frames in the animation), and all the color cycling data.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sean\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alternate_dph&quot; &lt;alterna=\r\nte_dph@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ran into a small problem trying to work o=\r\nn the graphics, mainly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; figuring out how the animation works in the ga=\r\nme.  Plus I got to\nfind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a program to convert pix files to gif files f=\r\nor java to handle it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m hoping to have something ready by February=\r\n 5.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
