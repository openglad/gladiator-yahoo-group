What about the rest?**\n\nI thought I sent a really nice, detailed message about what I&#39;d like to see.. ah well, I guess I didn&#39;t.\n\nIdeally, the map editor should be a native Windows 32-bit application.\n\nOn a technical level, this solves switching the problem of switching video-modes to a dos-based application, caps memory overflows that were a feature of MS-DOS compatability (reduces crashes and incompatabilities, and allows use of the map editor on an NT kernel)\n\nObviously, this would look similar in style to the current editor; a simple click will drop tiles underneath the mouse cursor. For large maps with huge segments of forests/walls/whatever could be aided with 3x3 or 5x5 &quot;brushes&quot;.\n\nBTW -- IIRC someone mentioned a while back that levels couldn&#39;t be custom-built.. ie, if you wanted a 5000x200 map, you&#39;d need to use one of the Gladiator-provided levels and modify it, that you couldn&#39;t simply create your own. Is this correct? (Um.. If I&#39;m wrong, then... uh... ignore this. ;))\n\nThere&#39;s more, but that&#39;s a start for now.\n\n-George &quot;Cookie&quot; Phillips\nAnime News Network\nCo-Editor-In-Chief\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com\n\n\n"}}
