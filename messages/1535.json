Speaking of grids, I wrote a pixedit program yesterday. \nIt doesn&#39;t actually edit pixes yet, but it views them. Its pixedit.c \nin the utils/ folder if you want to check it out. Latest in CVS works \nquite well.  This will also work for map grid files.\n\nMy initial test of integrating all components shown in the GUI works \ngreat except for one thing: I can&#39;t quite read from the grid file the \nmax x value and max y value.  I was looking through your code in \npixedit.c to find that information, but I can&#39;t seem to follow it.  \nWhat byte number in the grid file is that information located and what \ntype of variable (integer or byte) is that information stored in?\n\n\n"}}
