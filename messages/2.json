If you re","rawEmail":"X-Digest-Num: 0\r\nMessage-ID: &lt;17248.0.2.959279670@...&gt;\r\nDate: Fri, 04 Sep 1998 13:56:05 -0400\r\nFrom: Tom Ricket &lt;tricket@...\r\nSubject: Version 3.8K information\r\n\r\n\nJust a brief note -- we&#39;ve released Gladiator version 3.8K, which fixes a few\nbugs and (finally) adds two special abilities to the Barbarian class.  If\nyou&#39;re interested in grabbing it, you can get it from:\n        http://www.fsgames.com/glad/registered/\nusing the standard password.\n\nHere&#39;s a brief description of the features added:\n\n1) Fixed &#39;friendly-ghost-scare&#39; bug\n\nThe ghost in 3.8J was somewhat confused, and would often scare his own\nteammates as well as enemies.  This has been fixed.\n\n2) Added patch for overflowing team members (extra characters will now be\nrandomly scattered over the map)\n\nThis is a &#39;patch&#39; rather than a real fix, but it works for now.  In earlier\nversions of the game, if you had &quot;too many&quot; (generally &gt; 20) characters in\nyour\nteam, some levels would just make them disappear and not show up on the\nlevel. \nWorse than that was the fact that those characters were then considered dead,\nand you&#39;d lose them when you went on to the next level.\n\nFor now, the fix we&#39;ve implemented is that any &quot;excess&quot; teammates will be\nscattered randomly around the map.  This certainly isn&#39;t ideal, and may create\nsome weird effects, but it&#39;s better than nothing :)\n\n3) Fixed Druid &#39;reveal&#39; ability\n\nThe Druid&#39;s &quot;reveal&quot; ability, which is designed to show treasure, potions,\ngenerators, etc., had been accidentally broken in the latest version.  It\nworks\nagain.\n\n4) Made exits and teleporters always show up on radar\n\nExits and teleporters now show up as glowing dots, which should eliminate some\nof the searching for a &quot;way out&quot; when you&#39;re done with a level :)\n\n5) Added Barbarian&#39;s first special: Hurl Boulder, an ability based on strength\n6) Added Barbarian&#39;s second special: Exploding boulder\n\nMore specific information:\n1.   Hurl Boulder: All barbarians have the ability to rip large stones from\nthe\nnearby ground and hurl them at enemies.  How far they can throw them, and the\ndamage the boulders impart, is strongly affected by the strength of the\nbarbarian.\n\n2.   Exploding Boulder: Using even more energy, a barbarian can hurl a rock\nwith such strength that it explodes upon impact, damaging any nearby foes.\n\nThat&#39;s it for now!  Let me (tricket@...) know if you notice any\nobvious\nerrors in this version!\n\n--Tom\n\n \n\n---------------------------- \nTom Ricket \n&lt;mailto:tricket@...&gt;mailto:tricket@... \nForgotten Sages Games \n&lt;http://www.fsgames.com&gt;http://www.fsgames.com \n---------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n"}}
