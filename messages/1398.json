PLEASE read gladiator_story.rtf. failure to \ndo so will result in a gang of blood-thirsty orcs coming into your \nhouse, howling at your dog, and eating the corpses you have stashed in \nyour basement.\n&gt; A big part of writing this is to get positive feedback from other \npeople reading it. If i don&#39;t get feedback, i kind of lack the \nincentive needed to continue writing. I was hoping for some big \nappreciation from &#39;Triad&#39; and Dancing Corpse after finishing chapter \n6/7. Also, getting some feedback from the big man upstairs (Tom Ricket \nof course) would be cool also.\n\nHey, I gave you feedback.  It&#39;s good so far.\n\n\n"}}
