I am not quite\nhappy about 1 thing, though.  How do I get the generators to generate\nmonsters faster?  When I was playing the level (with illegimate\nteam),\nI did not see any signs that the generators were actually doing\nanything.  How much free space do I need around a generator for it to\nwork, if any?\n\nIf anyone wants to test it, let me know and I will update it.\nOtherwise, I will just upload the whole thing at once and hope they\nare not too tough.\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
