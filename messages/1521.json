I think you already\nreverse-engeneered it, but if there&#39;s anything you&#39;re not sure of, its\nprobably described in there. The format of the .001 files is also\nsomewhere in the source (or if not, you can see it by looking through\nutils/gladpack.c)\n\n&gt; Terrain generation, item placement, enemy placement - all this isnt\n&gt; easy to do!
