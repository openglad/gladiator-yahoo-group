I was \nexpecting a &#39;No Way, That would make characters too powerfull&#39; \nargument from somebody.\n\n&gt; How about adding halfing classes (mixture of two character types) if \n&gt; they both have experience levels above 20? Like combining a &#39;High \n&gt; Priest&#39; with an &#39;Archmage&#39; would result in two characters which each \n&gt; have half its original abilites and half the abilities of the other \n&gt; one.  The catch: all the specials must be present between the two of \n&gt; them: example both of them couldn&#39;t have the power of &#39;Heal&#39;, \n&#39;Summon \n&gt; Image/Summon Fire Elemental&#39;, etc.  You could NOT place halfings in \n&gt;a scenario using the editor to fight against.\n\n\n"}}
