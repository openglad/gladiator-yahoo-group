In that message, I did claim all unclaimed \nscenario numbers up to 200.  Even though I have only stopped at 136, I \nstill have a ways to go.  I want at least three future scenarios for \nmost character classes plus 6 more scenarios [Reminder: my series is \nabout a training grounds and it would reasonable to have specialized \nareas for each type of character.].  Then I have to do an ending to \nthe series, which will be about 2-4 scenarios.  Of course, the last \nscenario will be somehow familiar.\n\n3rd, the only other viable option for maintaining a list of what \nscenario numbers is a table in the database feature.  Only one problem \nwith that, though.  How would anyone new in this egroup know to look \nin the database for a list of claimed scenario numbers?  \n\nMy suggestion would be for the moderators to put some message on the \nfront door of this group about how to find out what scenario numbers \nare claimed.  \n\nBeyond that, someone probably needs to repost a message every once in \na while (as soon as the old message about what scenario numbers are \nclaimed gets out of sight) explaining which scenario numbers are \ntaken.  That is about all any of us can do to prevent such overlaps in \nthe future.\n\n\n"}}
