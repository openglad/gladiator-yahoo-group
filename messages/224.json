If\nI\nam wrong let me know within 7 days:\n\n115-204 are open (I am thinking about claiming those)\n\n350 and up are open\n\nMario, what is the highest level number you are going to be using?\n\nI want enough levels for a 100% legitimate team to be able to beat my\nextreme level.  The special ended up in the millions.  I estimate it\nwill take at least a level 50 archmage and a couple of level 40\nclerics to be able to win.\n\nTo that end, I will be designing levels that give lots of experience\nand at least $1,000,000 in treasure.\n\nIf we are going to have so many levels, should not somebody try to\ntie\nthem together in as few zip files as possible?\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
