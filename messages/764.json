You have to realize there is \nonly so much you can do in Gladiator the way it is currently coded.\n\nThings like speeding up chain-lightning (as indicated by Tom Ricket) \nwould require changing a lot of things.  Adding formation control to \nyour team is another because the game would have to be changed from \nthe inside to make it better suited for that type of thing.  Things \nlike adding new characters and adding (most) new attacks won&#39;t require \nsignificantly changing the code.\n\n\n"}}
