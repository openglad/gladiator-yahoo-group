School has been the main cause of\ndelay. I didn&#39;t do any coding for fun for the past 3 months due to a\nsuper busy quarter at UCSB (go computer science). I am on winter\nbreak now and have spent the past couple days working on Openglad-e.\n\nAs mentioned elsewhere, we are doing a lot of work on the code\nstructure, class relationships, etc, and I made some significant\nprogress on that this week. Check these screenshots out:\n\nhttp://snowstorm.sourceforge.net/screenshots/openglad-e_two_levels.jpg\nhttp://snowstorm.sourceforge.net/screenshots/openglad-e_viewrez.jpg\n\nThe first screenshot shows two views, with a different level loaded in\neach, and both levels actually being played on by the AI. I doubt we\nwill include the capability of having two teams playing different\nlevels at once in the final version, but it gives a good idea of how\nmuch more flexible our current code is.\n\nThe second screenshot is similar to the previous one but just shows an\nincrease in window resolution, allowing nearly two full sized views.\nImagine playing at 1024x768 fullscreen with 4 players, all players\nhaving a nice sized playing field.\n\nAlso, note the awesome new grass tile, created by Warren Wilkinson. \n\nSean\n\n\n\n\n"}}
