For example, &quot;Revenue,&quot; who is on your team\nsplits.  Now there is Revenue, and Revenue Jr.  If Revenue splits again, he\nwill make another Junior, but if Revenue Jr. Splits, he will make a nameless\nblob off himself.  Have you seen how many generations it takes before they\nstart becoming unnamed? (or rather... SLIME1 etc.)  Only Revenue is &#39;on your\nteam&#39; so he is the anomaly that spawns the others, the one, if you will.\nFrom: Daniel Paul Hightower [mailto:alternate_dph@...]\nSent: Sunday, December 14, 2003 8:33 PM\nI start with a slime called &quot;Revenue&quot;.  After it repeatedly splits,\neventually slimes with no name will show up.  Hypothetically,\nall slimes can from &quot;Revenue&quot; so all slimes should have a name, but that\ndoesn&#39;t happen.\n\nMy question is when and why that happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\nYahoo!
