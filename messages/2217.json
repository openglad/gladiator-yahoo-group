However, it is summer\nnow so classes are a mute point :)\n\nBalancing is very important. Class data is currently stored in Lua\nscripts so they can be easily tweaked for balancing purposes without\nneeding the original source code for the game.\n\nOne of these days I need to sit down and get the code compiling in\nWindows so you guys can see how progress is doing with Openglad-e. \n \n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;fuzinavl&quot; &lt;fuzinavl@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Woah, I didn&#39;t know I was still a member of this board.\n&gt; I&#39;m glad to see that openglad-e is still in development.\n&gt; I hope the classes get balanced, and the XP system stableized.\n&gt; Then it would be perfect!\n&gt; \n&gt; Too bad I can&#39;t get the shrouder source code to tapan-kaikki.\n&gt; That would look sweet in glad.
