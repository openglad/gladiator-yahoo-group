I think that scenario takes about 10 seconds or so to load on my\nPC.  Almost every object (all but one player 1 position, a few magic\npotions, and a few faeries) is gold.  Building that scenario took a\nlot of time.  On the other hand, the purpose of that scenario was to\nsave me time creating super-powered characters for testing.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
