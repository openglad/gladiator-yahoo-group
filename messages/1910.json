Something\nreally simple, like, armor and weapon.  There would be an activation key to\nbring up inventory for character (only out of combat, or in if you liked)\nwith his currently eqipeed weapon, and his currently equiped armor, plus a\nlist of all the weapons and armor he had.  From this menu, you could swap\nout armors, swap out weapons, etc.  Also, the inventory would be of the\nwhole team, not of just this one character.  Too keep this very simple,\ncharacters could only use thier own class related weapon, ie: Soldier could\nonly use blades.  When he kills an enemy soldier/hero soldier, there would\nbe a chance of dropping a blade.  When the soldier walks up to the corpse,\nhe would pick up this blade and put it in the team inventory similar to\neating meat, or drinking a potion.  Should a character die, his equipment\nwould be lost/fall to the ground.\n\nSome weapons stuff (while i&#39;m rambling so i don&#39;t forget):\ndruid: lightning staff\ncleric: mace/holy staff\narcher: bow\nthief: knives\nmage: force wand\num... yeah, you might get the point...\n\nArmor would be universally equippable.\n\nItems in inventory might also be able to be &#39;sold&#39; in the menu, trading it\nfor cash.\n\nNow, what effectively weapons would do, is, based on what the weapon\nattributes are, increase damage basically.  Armor would obviously add armor,\nsimilar to the stat.\n\nWell...  thats my craziness for today\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Daniel Paul Hightower [mailto:alternate_dph@...]\nSent: Saturday, August 30, 2003 5:26 PM\nTo: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [gladiator] Negative Items\n\n\nHow many people would like to see items in Gladiator that do harm?\n\nSomething like &quot;spoiled meat&quot; that would reduce health, potions that\nwould take away mana, slow down a player, etc?\n\nAlong the same lines, I would actually like &quot;cheat codes&quot; that do\n&quot;harm&quot;.\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
