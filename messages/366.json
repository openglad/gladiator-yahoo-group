A level 5\n&gt;mage with 20 intelligence has more mana than a level 1 mage with 20\n&gt;intelligence.  Gladiator was programmed in C, which has limits to the\n&gt;variables -- when these limits are crossed, the variables plunge into the\n&gt;realm of negatives.  Various calculations that the game performs could\n&gt;cause program upsets that causes it to crash.\n\nIt&#39;s not specifically due to using C, but rather what limits and checks we \nput into the game.  We used 16-bit values for most of the in-game \nvariables, which we felt was a reasonable limit for any &quot;real&quot; team \n:)  Chris is perfectly right about weird behavior when those values are \nexceeded -- they can become negative, which really confuses formulas, or \nthey can just misbehave in general when they&#39;re too big .. especially if a \nformula is something like x*x, or x*y*z, or even (yikes!) x^2....\n\nIn the most common cases, we put in checks to make sure this doesn&#39;t cause \nproblems, but with super-high values, there are definitely places in the \ngame that can get confused (ie, crash or behave really strangely).\n\n&gt;The reason that your editor and game crashes when your grid is too\n&gt;large is probably because the game does not allocate enough memory\n&gt;from the heap to hold the data effectively.  This anomoly is, once\n&gt;again, good recipe for a crash.\n\nI think (I don&#39;t have the source in front of me, so I&#39;m not sure), that the \ngrid was hard-coded as a 256x256 maximum tile size.  That&#39;s because when we \nfirst created the simple &quot;pix&quot; graphic format, we used single-byte values \nto define the X and Y dimensions .. most of our early scenarios were more \nlike 60x100 in size, so we figured we had plenty of room :)\n\n&gt;The reasons behind this are probably because you&#39;re pushing the game\n&gt;to its limits.  I believe that, fundamentally, gladiator should be able to\n&gt;operate on a 386 without too much hampering by the system&#39;s\n&gt;resources (or lack thereof).  I think that this is how the game was\n&gt;originally designed without enormous scenarios being taken into mind.\n\nThat&#39;s pretty much correct, also :)  We optimized a lot of Gladiator to \nmake sure that it ran fine on a 386-style machine with one megabyte of \nmemory :)  A 486 with, say, 8 megs of memory could make the game fly and be \nvery happy ;-)\n\nBecause of that, there were things we did that would be different if we did \na special &quot;new processor&quot; style upgrade today :)  Things like limits on \nobject/scenario sizes, speed settings (playing the game on &#39;10&#39; is \nbasically unplayable on any modern system), etc., were all designed for \nolder/slower/smaller systems.\n\n&gt;This touches again on my proposal that the level designers out there\n&gt;design scenarios with a starting team in mind -- without the\n&gt;expectation that the player&#39;s characters will reach levels in the\n&gt;hundreds.\n\nDefinitely true.  Basically, what we did to try to play-balance the \nscenarios was to start a number of teams, from scratch, and play through \nall our existing scenarios.  This let us test to make sure that, for \nexample, level 6 wasn&#39;t suddenly twice as hard, or twice as easy, as level \n5 or 7 .. and it let us tweak values (how much gold is on a level, how many \nmonster generators are there, etc.) until we got levels that seemed to play \nright, from the start.\n\nOf course, playing new, player-made levels, with new characters (ie, the \nArchMage was designed later, and never really meant to fit into the &#39;early&#39; \nscenarios) can drastically alter how the game balance feels!\n\nTake care,\n    Tom\n\n\n"}}
