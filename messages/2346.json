You can get at\nthem at: http://snowstorm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snowstorm/openglad-e/trunk/pix/jpg/\nor just check out the openglad-e svn repository and look in\ntrunk/pix/jpg. The PNGs in the directory above that (trunk/pix) have\nactual transparency instead of the pink color, so if there&#39;s some way\nyou can work with PNGs, they&#39;ll probably be a bit easier. I used 100%\nquality on the jpegs and PNGs are lossless, so those should be more or\nless how FSGames drew them.\n\nGood luck!\n- Zardus\n\n&gt; On Sun, Jun 22, 2008 at 10:29 PM, alternate_dph &lt;alternate_dph@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; I&#39;m hoping by the end of this week to have things set where we can\n&gt;&gt; view real maps.
