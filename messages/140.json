I figured gladiator fans would be cool people who spent quite a bit \nof time online...Apparently, I was being to idealistic. I&#39;ve only posted \ntwice on this mailing list; and both times with good intentions. Seeing as \nhow last month i made $20 and one of my friends almost $50, I assumed \n(mistakingly) you guys would appreciate my attempt at keeping you guys \ninformed. I am most definitely not soliciting (and if you don&#39;t believe me \ngo to http://www.alladvantage.com and just read what it says, you don&#39;t have \nto join, just read what it says). Finally, where do you go off threatening \nme? &quot;Not so much &#39;please&#39; as &#39;or else&#39;...&quot; Or else what?\n\n&gt;From: maxim@...
