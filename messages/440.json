However, after \n&gt; playing it with my friend, we beat it WITH the faeries alive as a \n&gt; condition, by having him make an ENEMY ghost and fear the heck out \nof \n&gt; the faeries until they are stuck in a corner. Then I proceeded to \nown \n&gt; the slimes with my Archer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just a few questions for you all, though:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Is the Archer&#39;s explosive arrow fire rate supposed to be THAT \n&gt; rediculous, or is it a bug?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Why the heck did DPH create a level with (arbitrarily large \n&gt; amount) of gold in it?\n\nI was probably working on a way that in 2 scenarios that I could end \nup with a mega-character (experience level 100 or higher).\n\n&gt; 3) I&#39;d like to see your unreleased scenarios, DPH... We&#39;ll see how \n&gt; the Storm of Death prevails over them.\n\nHehehe.  I do not think that would be a wise idea.  Some of my \nunreleased scenarios resulted in . . . crashing the game [too much \nexprience gained, which is why I am for putting limits on Druids, \nClerics, and Archmages).  I&#39;ll check to see if I have not deleted any \nof them, but I think I deleted them.  If I find any, hehehe, I might \nhave to put them under the label of &#39;Scenarios of Doom&#39;.\n\nI am expecting my new PC to arrive on Wednesday.  It will be 1 \ngigahertz clockspeed.  What speed setting should I choose for this \ngame when playing on that PC?\n\n\n"}}
