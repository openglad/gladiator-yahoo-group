Implementing a way for team 1 to \nhave time slowed down while team 2 also has time slowed down while \nteam 3 also has time slowed down . . basically, it can get \ninteresting.  For example, suppose every team except numbers 7 & 8  \nhave time slowed down.  How exactly do you calculate how fast team \nnumbers 7 & 8 work and be equitable to everybody else?\n \n&gt; Oh well, screw you, you&#39;ll _never_ get the multiplayer version.\n\nI won&#39;t play against that guy if if it can&#39;t be a fair attack.\n\n\n"}}
