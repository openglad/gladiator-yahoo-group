Well, since I just started my fall\nsemester, Jesse has gotten moved to the back-burner at the moment\nwhile I play catch-up with my classes (that&#39;ll teach me to check the\ncalendar more often for when classes start so I don&#39;t miss the 1st 2\ndays).\n\nI&#39;m not too happy with my circles not being round:\n\nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/thumbnails/SCEN122.bmp - 833 kb\nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/thumbnails/SCEN122.jpg -  55 kb\nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/thumbnails/SCEN122.gif -  23 kb\n\nwhich is tempting me to make the images even bigger.  Anyways, Does\nanyone think the jpg (ok, this is getting ridiculous; I keep wanting\nto type jpb instead of jpg) pic looks ugly compared to the other two?\n Just taking an opinion poll before I start adding the code to do\nsomething about only saving in bmp format.\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n \nYahoo!
