If lurkers out there say to yourselves &#39;I&#39;ll \nparticipate in a tournament when I know more specifics&#39;, I reply that \nno specifics will be discussed until enough people show interest.\n\nBTW, if anyone wants to argue the point about how few people it takes \nto have a decent tournament, I have an open mind.\n\n\n"}}
