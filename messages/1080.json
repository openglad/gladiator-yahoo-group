Then, I payed a bit more\n&gt; attention the Tyrx scenarios are version 6.0.\n\nYeah, there were little things added in each version according to the specs\nwe were given.\nYou could write one to handle older versions and convert up without too much\nhassle, I think it is planned as one of the last things to do in the editor\nwe&#39;re supposed to be building :)\n\n&gt; I am having to manually calculate the number of bytes in my file to\n&gt; make the viewing the information with for text edit perform at a\n&gt; decent speed.  Once I get my current step done, I&#39;ll compile it and\n&gt; let people examine phase 1 of the program.\n&gt;\n&gt; Have all the built-in scenarios been converted to version 8.0?  If\n&gt; not, would saving the file with the built-in scenario editor result in\n&gt; a scenario file of version 8.0?\n\nNot all of them are version 8, but yes, I think Tom said that the built in\neditor saves them in version 8, so you can use that as a converter.\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
