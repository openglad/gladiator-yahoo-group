Do you guys think the existing symbols on the radar screen\nare adequate or do you think possibly, some things need to change in\nterms of how objects are presented on the radar map in the game of\ngladiator?\n\nRight now, that&#39;s what&#39;s I&#39;m working on with these thumbnails images -\nessentially using a ported-out Radar function with my personal ideas\nfor changes I think would make things better.\n\nIt&#39;s better to address the issue now, so that when the folks at\nSnowstorm actually do get around to revising the Radar code, we can\nget our suggestions implemented off the bat.\n\n\n"}}
