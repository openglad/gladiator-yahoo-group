For example, \nI&#39;ll have a \n&gt; character run toward a foe, shooting his weapon, and suddenly back \noff just \n&gt; before I run into him. The shots build up behind you, and as the \nenemy walks \n&gt; straight toward you, they hit him all at once like a ton of bricks. \nBrutal.\n\n\nI&#39;ve actually done something similiar with an archer and exploding \nbolts [Only problem was pulling the archer out soon enough to avoid \nkilling the archer].  Against normal opponents, that is instant \nslaughter.\n\n\nI would be crueler about chain lightning:  it has to kill an opponent \nbefore it could spread (I&#39;ve seen chain lightning pass through \nopponents without killing them) and the limit would be set the player \n(minimum 5, maximum 50) and graphical representation of chain \nlightning would be optional [that would speed things up quite a bit], \nbut the speed setting for chain lightning would be set so high that it \nbasically kills an opponent, next second kills another opponent, until \nit runs out.\n\n\n"}}
