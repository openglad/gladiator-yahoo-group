As soon as I can get on a comp with a \nbetter browser (i.e. not IE) I&#39;ll fix that all up properly.\n\nStrategy? Well, I must confess that my most effective team consists of one \narchmage. Alone. His chain lightning is THE most impressive effect in the \ngame. I&#39;ve been able to kill everyone in a level with one blast. Of course, \nthere are serious drawbacks to using one character with a bad hand-to-hand. \nAgainst an enemy with a comparable level, it takes forever to do serious \ndamage, so it&#39;s usually best to &#39;port away and create a flock of elementals \nto do your dirty work. You can also summon the image of a druid and use it \nto create real faerie to freeze the opponent. I&#39;ve been experimenting with a \nteam of two clerics, a mage, and an archmage, but it seems to take too long \nto advance them to massive-kill levels. It&#39;s just too hard to use teams, \nunless you go in with overwhelming force or struggle to keep everyone \ntogether with yells. If there were going to be further versions of the game, \nI would suggest that team play be improved...\n\nDPH, what do you mean an RP? A Gladiator fan-fic? That would be cool, I \nguess... I incorporated a running storyline into my scenarios, but that&#39;s \nnot really the same. (It turned out much better than Tryxian Chronicles...) \nEveryone seems to love Torvald and Neldwyn; why don&#39;t we see who can write \nthe best Torvald story? Or maybe a Torvald theme song?\n                 -Tevildo.\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
