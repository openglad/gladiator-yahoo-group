The game is most fun on Battle, but I always played on slaughter. With my brothers and I jamming around the keyboard, we had one fighter, one cleric, and one mage. That was it.\nThe cleric built up a &quot;base&quot; of sparkles, and the mage and fighter ran around, beat people up, then retreated back to the &#39;base&#39; for healing before repeating.\nThe comps can&#39;t seem to handle anything other than walking against the side walls of the map. Sure they respond to &quot;YO!&quot; but only for a few seconds.\n\nHire a small team. Try and get them controlled by humans. Or play on an easy dif. and get no exp. thats&#39; about it.\n\n-----Original Message-----\n&gt; DOes anybody have an idea of the best order to buy your team if you \n&gt; should buy all of it right away or buy it little buy little\n&gt; \n&gt; Peter NEvill\n\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free! \r\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143 \r\n\r\n\n\n"}}
