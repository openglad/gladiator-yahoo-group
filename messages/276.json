Is this supposed to \n&gt; happen? From the looks of the files in that ZIP, some of us could cobble \n&gt; together a decent set of playable levels... assuming that the basic code \n&gt; works. It might need some minor (or serious, I don&#39;t know) straightening \n&gt; out, which is beyond me at this point.
