You can use any graphics program to conv=\r\nert the tga files to\njust about any other format.\n\nIf you are interested in=\r\n it, its located in the Openglad-e SVN\nrepository. SVN instructions can be =\r\nfound at:  \nhttp://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=3D50083\n\nThe C program is =\r\nlocated in openglad-e/trunk/util/convert.c. All the\ntarga graphics are loca=\r\nted in openglad-e/trunk/pix. Note though that\nall the graphics have an extr=\r\na row of pixels at the top. We were going\nto use this row to store frame da=\r\nta for the animations (such as the\nnumber of frames in the animation), and =\r\nall the color cycling data.\n\nSean\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alter=\r\nnate_dph&quot; &lt;alternate_dph@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I ran into a small problem trying =\r\nto work on the graphics, mainly\n&gt; figuring out how the animation works in t=\r\nhe game.  Plus I got to find\n&gt; a program to convert pix files to gif files =\r\nfor java to handle it. \n&gt; I&#39;m hoping to have something ready by February 5.=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
