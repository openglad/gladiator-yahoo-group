I don&#39;t have any viruses on computer and I don&#39;t want to give any \n&gt;viruses to any one else. I just want levels for gladiators. I&#39;m no \n&gt;anarchist and i&#39;m not a hacker. I just want gladiator levels. Does any \n&gt;one have gladiators levels that I can play or not????\n\nActually, I don&#39;t mind sending levels; as long as nobody&#39;s going to sue for\nwhatever&#39;s on them, it doesn&#39;t bother me :)\n\nAt the moment, the &quot;Tryxian Chronicles&quot; are the main user-made levels for\nGladiator. However, one of the users of this mailing list is working to compile\nsome of the levels that we&#39;ve received, but never had time to put up. He thinks\nhe might have something done by the end of Monday, and while I certainly\nwouldn&#39;t hold him to a time scale (that&#39;d be hypocritical, eh? ;-&gt;), I wouldn&#39;t\nbe surprised if he posts something about them soon. So watch this list over the\nnext few days and let&#39;s see what develops.\n\n--Tom\n\n \n\n---------------------------- \nTom Ricket \n&lt;mailto:tricket@...&gt;mailto:tricket@... \nForgotten Sages Games \n&lt;http://www.fsgames.com&gt;http://www.fsgames.com \n---------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n"}}
