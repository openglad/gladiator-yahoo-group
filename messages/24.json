Any pages will do, I&#39;m not looking for anything exclusive.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d really like to take a look at what maps other players have made, and also how they play -- the strategies they use.\r\n\r\nI have a page up at \r\n\r\nhttp://members.xoom.com/shayd/glad.html \r\n\r\nfor those who are interested in looking.  It just has some strategy on clerics, mages, and thieves; no maps yet.  (Unfortunately all my good maps were erased when I had to format my hard drive, but I&#39;ll be making more.)\r\n\r\n-Chris\r\n  / Shayd\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
