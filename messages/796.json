Download my &#39;Torture&#39; scenarios, and extract info from numbers \n333 (one opponent: an archmage); 402 (one opponent: slime with lots of \nmagic potions); or 666 (two opponents: mage and archmage).  That&#39;s the \nscenarios I have made that have the fewest objects in them.  Those \nwill also give you a good test of high level numbers go in the grid \nfile.\n\n\n"}}
