That way I\n&gt; could put a high level mage around, but take away the ability to\n&gt; freeze time.  Or put a high-level archmage around, and prevent him\n&gt; from accessing chain-lightning.\n\nThat would be cool, though I suspect it&#39;d require changes to the game code\n(read: another patch) as right now the game probably works out what\nabilities someone has from their level.\n\nI&#39;m not sure how much work would be required to implement it however I\nsuspect it to be reasonable depending on if the abilities are separated from\nthe level  (so when it checks it just says &quot;ok, at this level this, this and\nthis abilitiy is on&quot;) or if they are somehow merged.\nThen you have to override the automatic checking for NPC&#39;s (I assume you\ndon&#39;t want to be applying this to players :) ) during scenario loads,\nalthough that could probably be achieved by a flag - nice and simple.\n\nIt&#39;s not something I think you could do with the scenario editor :)\n\nCya,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
