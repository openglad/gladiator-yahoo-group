I also thaught the cleric could be devided into \nnecromancer and healer, which would both go here.\n\nMonsters: the horde. everything else including slimes, all sommoned versons \nof creatures ect. alot of new charectors could go here. these creatures \ncould either be un hireable or hireable but untrainable.\n\na few more points are that inproving any summonable charecter class inproves \ntheir summoner exponentially, so all summoned charecters we want to inprove \nshould have 2 versons, the summoned kind and the hired kind. also if we make \ntoo meny new types of charecters we could give new charecter types as prizes \nafter certain levels, if thats programable. finally we need to remember that \nsomeone needs to draw something like 16 pictures for each now class (not 2 \nlike the giant skeleton).\n\nthank you all for hearing me out. i&#39;m probably making no sense. are we even \ncontemplating new charecter classes to make changes to the game or cuz we \nfeal like it, like we did 2 years ago. i&#39;m probably gunna drop out of the \ngroup again after i send this letter because i have my GCSEs soon (any brits \non this list?). if a patch of gladiator is coming out i look forward to it. \nif not i need to look farther forward.\n\ni&#39;ll respond to anything this week. then i&#39;ll be gone for a week\n\nbi\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\nps. a don&#39;t thing the orc captian should be given swimming and net throwing \nbecause these are both aquatic abilities and there is nothing watery about \nthe orc captian. the orc captain should be what the golum wished it were: an \nubserdly powerful base attacker with only a few do even MORE dammage-ish \nabilities\n\n\n\n\nFrom: &quot;ineedhelpnow2&quot; &lt;ineedhelpnow2@...&gt;\nReply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nTo: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [gladiator] Re: CE: Orc Captains and Thieves\nDate: Mon, 31 Mar 2003 02:26:34 -0000\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot;\n&lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt; wrote:\n &gt; This week we are talking about orc captains and thieves.\n &gt;\n &gt; (If I have overlooked any existing character class, let me know\nbefore\n &gt; next week)\n\nOrc Captians - as of now they are a joke, you might as well be a\nsoldier and get the magical abilities.\n\nHmm... I cant really think of GOOD abilities for the Orc Captian\nw/out copying other classes. BUT one really cool &quot;ability&quot; that orc\ncaptians could have (this probably would be hard to code) could be\nRally Troops, where allied troops in the surrounding area would get a\nboost to health, speed, and magic for a short duration (for every\ntime cast.)\n\n\nThieves- This class is really quite ausome and devisating once you\nget high leveled bombs.\n\nWith the addition of doors in many levels I think the theives should\nhave the ability to Pick Locks and pass through doors without having\nto find the keys.\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nSTOP MORE SPAM with the new MSN 8 and get 2 months FREE* \nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n"}}
