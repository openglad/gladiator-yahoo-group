Where can I find it?  FSgames.com\n&gt; seems to be defunct.\n\nYou can download Openglad, the open sourced Gladiator, from\nhttp://snowstorm.sf.net. It has some issues under Windows, but other than\nthat its mostly a complete port and even has good joystick support in\nLinux. Openglad 0.97 has a bug with aborting levels that we havn&#39;t gotten\naround to fixing yet, so you might want to grab 0.95 instead.\n\nAlternatively, if you want the old DOS version of Gladiator (which, being\nwritten for DOS, could have serious problems depending on your setup), you\ncan email Tom Ricket and as him about getting a copy of Gladiator. I\nthink he still has the names of everyone who registered it. Also, if you\nstill remember the password of the registered version, there is a\ndownload online at http://www.geocities.com/rnbno/games/games.html , but\nyou need the password to exract it.\n\n- Yan\n\n\n"}}
