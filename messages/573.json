Using\n&gt;standard C++ means it will then be compileable on a wide range of compilers.\n&gt;I take it the editor will be a native Win32 application, which just means\n&gt;that anyone without MVC++ will need the windows platform SDK and set it up -\n&gt;no big hassle, I know at least one free compiler (DJGPP) that runs in both\n&gt;DOS and Windows that can do it.\n\nAlthough we can&#39;t release the entire project for free (due to contracts we \nhave with places still selling Gladiator, etc), I&#39;d have no objections at \nall to letting any of you take blocks of the code -- especially things like \nparts of the scenario editor, etc. -- if it would help.  Obviously you&#39;d \nprobably want to re-code it, but I know that having the source there in \nfront of you can often help.  So, if that would be at all useful, let me \nknow and I can provide it.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
