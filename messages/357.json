I try to get the character killed?  If only \nthat was possible.\n\n  The sad point is my legitimate archmage could be at that same point \nwithin 5 scenarios.  You see, I had the archmage up  against level \n2000 and level 3000 slime.  The slime were powerfull to destroy my \nsummoned fire elementals with one blow!  It took a good strategy to \nget the fire elementals to kill the slime.\n\nWhich brings me to a question I was going to ask:  what is the most \nefficient way to create an army of so called &#39;gods&#39;?  Use high level \nslime and let them multiply, or use high level treehouses?  Or some \nbetter idea?\n\nSpeaking of &#39;gods&#39;, I finally working definition of when I will be \nhappy with a given character: when said character can not run out of \nmagic power unless time is frozen.\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Tom Tildrum&quot; &lt;Tevildo@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &lt;&lt;blah blah archmage who can&#39;t attack, but all scenarios are reset \nblah \n&gt; blah&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Sounds like this might be a good character to throw on a team of \nnormal \n&gt; characters. Or, more practically, you might run an orc or cleric or \nsome \n&gt; other tough-but-useless-and-slow character over his HP limit and \nhave him \n&gt; just sit there and stagnate, resetting the scenario while your other \n&gt; characters do the fighting.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
