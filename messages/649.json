I&#39;d say less interesting.\n\nAs powerfull as mages and archmages are, they both have a very strong \nweakness: faeries.  Clerics are next in line for strength, what are \ntheir weaknesses?  They can only summon new characters if you left \nblood stains on a scenario or some character has died.  \n\nWhat about Druids, Thieves, and Elves?  Druids can summon the faeries \nthat are the achilles heal of mages/archmages.  Thieves can turn \ninvisible and keep attacking you, making them worthy opponents.  Elves \ncan run into a forest and recooperate health without much fear of \nbeing attacked.  Ghosts can be used to chase away your opponents, \nwhile skeletons are near impossible to hit because of their speed and \ntunneling ability.  I could go on about every character being roughly \nequal if you exclude a few.  Each of those few has a weakness in their \npowers.\n\nI am tempted, when I finish my set of scenarios, to send a 100% \nlegitimate team with a lot of characters through most available \nscenarios.\n\n\n"}}
