Just out of curiosity, how did David Chan get Tryx\n&gt;posted on the real Glad page? I&#39;m sure there are some players that aren&#39;t on\n&gt;the mailing list, and they won&#39;t know about any new levels coming out...\n\nDavid got his Tryx levels to us .. hmm, way back when :) Basically, back \nwhen we were working on Gladiator much more often than we do now :)\n\nI&#39;d be happy to put up other sets of levels for people .. basically, I just \nneed someone (or the list at large) to verify that (a) they don&#39;t suck, and \n(b) they won&#39;t screw up people&#39;s existing levels when they&#39;re unzipped to a \ndirectory.. I used to try to do both of those myself .. and that&#39;s why \nthere aren&#39;t really many levels up there :) But if some of you can do the \nhard part, and then send me the files zipped up as an e-mail attachment, I \ncan try to put them on the page.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
