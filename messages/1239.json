For example, an \nexp level 1 faerie can only have one spell of protection placed on it \ndue to its low health value.  Characters with greater health will be \nallowed to have more spells of protection around them.\n\nThere should be a limit to how many spells of protection a character \ncan have on it.  You shouldn&#39;t have fuzzy images in the place of \ncharacter surrounded by spells of protection.\n\nOf course, when a character dies, all spells of protection around the \ncharacter should disappear.\n\n\n"}}
