Also, what we need to\nchange are Caps to skills and stats that each character has.  For example, a\nmage should have a limit to the amount of strengh he/she has, otherwise,\nwhat would be the point of a fighter who would have the same strength and no\nmagic power at all.  we should nerf the mages strength so it has a weak\nphysical attack, but keep a high cap for intellegence and charisma. we\nshould have increased effects of special attacks by lv, and finally, we\nshould actually gain skills and stat points by experience and not by gold,\nbecause realistically, you can&#39;t buy those kinds of skills through money,\nbut by killing the creatures and enemies, and getting the experience, it\nwould seem that your practicing your characters skills, and as they raise by\nlv (or Usage of the skill), attacks would be more effective.\n\nand who says i don&#39;t participate in these conversations, =)\n\n\nThis is another message sent by the infamous Ricky Der, The Legendary Light.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Daniel Paul Hightower [mailto:dph_of_rules@...]\nSent: Sunday, June 10, 2001 1:01 PM\nTo: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [gladiator] Wish List Part 2\n\n\nOk, this the part we can express how we would like existing characters\nand their actions changed.  Part 3 will be about suggested new\ncharacters.  Part 4 wil be about features for Gladiator:Beyond\nFreedom.\n\nWhy bother?  In the off chance that the gladiator folks get back\ntogether and start to work on Gladiator.\n\nI will start with a couple of points:\n\n1)when all the opponents are defeated and all enemy generators are\ndestroyed, all characters SHOULD stop using any attacks.\n\n2)your teammates should be, when they reach a certain experience\nlevel, smart enough to destroy enemy trees that are blocking their\npath.\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
