The game is most fun on Battle, but I always played on \nslaughter. With my brothers and I jamming around the keyboard, we had \none fighter, one cleric, and one mage. That was it.\n&gt; The cleric built up a &quot;base&quot; of sparkles, and the mage and fighter \nran around, beat people up, then retreated back to the &#39;base&#39; for \nhealing before repeating.\n&gt; The comps can&#39;t seem to handle anything other than walking against \nthe side walls of the map. Sure they respond to &quot;YO!&quot; but only for a \nfew seconds.\n\nI would almost wager a thief&#39;s taunt is more effective about bringing \nyour opponents to you than &#39;Yo&#39; command does for bringing your own \nteammates to you.\n \n&gt; Hire a small team. Try and get them controlled by humans. Or play on \nan easy dif. and get no exp. thats&#39; about it.\n\nThat&#39;s my point for wanting &#39;The 50 project&#39;.  50 or so scenarios that \n can gradually build your team up to the point where each character \ncan take care of itself.\n\n\n"}}
