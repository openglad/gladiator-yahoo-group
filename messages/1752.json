Let&#39;s here those new ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would bring back the idea of a couple of promoted characters:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)practical mage - same basic attack A mage,\n&gt; with teleport and leave teleport marker as 1st attack\n&gt; with stop time and slow down time as 2nd attack\n&gt; teleport teammates and teleport opponents as 3rd attack\n&gt; create teleporter and create blackhole (anything steps inside is \n&gt; killed) as 4th attack.\n&gt; \n&gt; The blackhole would be one of the most powerfull attacks.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2)High priest, same basic type as cleric,\n&gt; 1st attack = heal/mystic mace\n&gt; 2nd attack = wide area heal/greater heal (heal beyond 100% health)\n&gt; 3rd attack = summon curse/undo curse (random selection of which \ncurse \n&gt; is applied from many choices)\n&gt; 4th attack = resurrect character / reincarinate character\n\n\n"}}
