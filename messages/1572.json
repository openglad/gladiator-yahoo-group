From now on, the straight Openglad port will\nonly be improved with bugfixes. Openglad Enhanced is where we are planning\nto make major feature enhancements and other wild stuff like that.\n\nSo, we are now starting on our drive to improve Openglad. Right now\nwe have getting the game to use a modern graphics format and making\nclasses and such into loadable files as our top priorities. If someone\nhas an feature they want in, they can either program it in and submit a\npatch or put in a feature request on the sourceforge project page\n(http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm). There are some other people\nworking on some other improvements already, but I&#39;ll leave it to them to\nexplain what they&#39;re doing if they want to.\n\nAs for Openglad the straight port, there are still some minor issues to be\nworked out, and as soon as they are worked out in Openglad Enhanced we\nwill backport them to Openglad normal. This way everyone can play an\nenhanced version of the game, and, if they want, try it out the way it was\nway back when.\n\nI know this list has some great ideas, so don&#39;t hesitate to submit feature\nrequests and/or write patches.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
