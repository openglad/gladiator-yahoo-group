Some base levels\nfor a &#39;classic&#39; feel (after all, so much of gladiator to me is defined by\nthe small stories inside), and a few new levels to introduce something\n&#39;new.&#39;\n\nI find it ironic that this discussion came just after the discussion on\nways to make your team ultra powerful without using the cheats --\nmassive healing after self-inflicted injuries, blob breeding, etc.\n\nAlso, I&#39;ll point out that most of the programming the Gladiator team\nis doing right now is not related to gladiator.  It&#39;s generally to pay\nthe bills, or, as many as you have heard, is for Blizzard software.\nProduction and development in gladiator has come to a halt (for the\ntime being) so we can&#39;t expect them to up and code something that\nwould manage this.  What we -could- propose is an honor system,\nwhere the players are responsible for the legitimacy of their own\nscores.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re giving out cash prizes or anything, and it\njust wouldn&#39;t be worth it to lie about your scores on something so\ntrivial.  It -is- a possibility, but not a huge concern if we decide to go\nthat route.\n\nA council might be in order, where a few dedicated people get\ntogether and chat on IRC or something and talk about exactly what\nthe tournament is going to be.  Five levels, three of which are from\nthe original game, two of which are original challengers?  A rule that\nplayers can only use one character, period? (This would eliminate\nthief/cleric combinations scarring themselves for experience.)  What\nwill the basic outline be?  Will there be a story?  What will the story\nbe?  Those kinds of questions could be answered by a number of\nindividuals.\n\n-Chris\n\n----- Original Message -----\nFrom: Daniel Paul Hightower &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, June 02, 2001 6:02 PM\nSubject: [gladiator] Tournment Scenarios\n\n\n&gt; ok, back on the question of having a tournament, (ignoring the issue\n&gt; of prizes for right now), what scenarios should be used?
