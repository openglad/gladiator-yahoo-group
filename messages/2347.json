I already sent a question to a java developer&#39;s group about\nthe po=\r\nssibility of reading in an image into an array of color variable\ntype.  It&#39;=\r\nll be a while before I&#39;m ready for that point, but it&#39;ll\nprobably take a wh=\r\nile to get a response.  I don&#39;t really like the\nquality of the gif or jpg. =\r\n You can really see the difference on the\ncolumn tiles.  I&#39;m going to spend=\r\n a little time designing a temporary\ninterface to allow me to view maps.\n\n-=\r\n-- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, Yan &lt;Zardus@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Openglad loade=\r\nd all the tile images and sprites when the program\n&gt; started but only loade=\r\nd the specific map&#39;s scen and pix files when\n&gt; they were needed (specifical=\r\nly, I think it was when the player pressed\n&gt; &quot;Go&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; I generated some J=\r\nPGs of the game&#39;s graphics for you. You can get at\n&gt; them at:\nhttp://snowst=\r\norm.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/snowstorm/openglad-e/trunk/pix/jpg/\n&gt; or jus=\r\nt check out the openglad-e svn repository and look in\n&gt; trunk/pix/jpg. The =\r\nPNGs in the directory above that (trunk/pix) have\n&gt; actual transparency ins=\r\ntead of the pink color, so if there&#39;s some way\n&gt; you can work with PNGs, th=\r\ney&#39;ll probably be a bit easier. I used 100%\n&gt; quality on the jpegs and PNGs=\r\n are lossless, so those should be more or\n&gt; less how FSGames drew them.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Good luck!\n&gt; - Zardus\n\n\n"}}
