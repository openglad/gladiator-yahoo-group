I&#39;ve written\n&gt;&gt; out a basic outline of how the rules would work\n&gt;&gt; on my own, and would be happy to organize it, but\n&gt;&gt; I need to know if anyone would participate.\n&gt;\n&gt;The only problem is that multiplayer Gladiator still is not possible \n&gt;unless it is on the same computer.  This means that only singler-\n&gt;player touraments are possible.  The problem with that is that \n&gt;people can cheat in single player mode.  \n\nWell...as long as we had no prizes or anything I don&#39;t think cheating would\nbe a problem...I mean would be the motivation to cheat for something like\nthis? I think it would be fun, and if no one cheated it would be interesting\nto see the results.\n-Maxim\n\n\n\n\n"}}
