Sounds like a good idea, right?  Wrong.  The damn druids \n&gt; basically covered their entire spot with trees and their protective \n&gt; spells so much that it slowed the game down.  I might try again with \n&gt; druids that have just enough experience to summon faeries, but not \ndo \n&gt; anything else besides creating faeries.\n\nOriginally, I had experience level 30 druids.  The concept works a lot \nbetter with experience level 9 druids.  It was kind of fun taking out \n250 faeries with one bomb.\n\n\n"}}
