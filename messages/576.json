Using\n&gt; &gt;standard C++ means it will then be compileable on a wide range of\ncompilers.\n&gt; &gt;I take it the editor will be a native Win32 application, which just means\n&gt; &gt;that anyone without MVC++ will need the windows platform SDK and set it\nup -\n&gt; &gt;no big hassle, I know at least one free compiler (DJGPP) that runs in\nboth\n&gt; &gt;DOS and Windows that can do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Although we can&#39;t release the entire project for free (due to contracts we\n&gt; have with places still selling Gladiator, etc), I&#39;d have no objections at\n&gt; all to letting any of you take blocks of the code -- especially things\nlike\n&gt; parts of the scenario editor, etc. -- if it would help.  Obviously you&#39;d\n&gt; probably want to re-code it, but I know that having the source there in\n&gt; front of you can often help.  So, if that would be at all useful, let me\n&gt; know and I can provide it.\n\nThat&#39;s great, once the group starts working on it I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll have bits\nand pieces they&#39;ll want :)\n\nThanks for all your help Tom!\n\nNow someone should gather all the info we&#39;ve got and put it somewhere\ncentral :)\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n\n"}}
