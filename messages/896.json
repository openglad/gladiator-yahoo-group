It wolud be nice if you could give orders to your\nteam to determine how they would behave, ie &quot;go kill stuff&quot;, &quot;stay\nalive&quot;, &quot;defend me&quot;, ect.  I usually use the &quot;sommon defence&quot; option,\nbut that&#39;s all you have, either yell for help, which works only kind of,\nor don&#39;t.  Then your clueless teamates usually just go die.\n\nComtriS@... wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; A one person team is the best only because you can control that character.\n&gt; With a team with more than one character either you let the AI suck, as\n&gt; usual, or you constantly switch between characters to make sure they do what\n&gt; you want them to do.  Even then it&#39;s hard to completely make a large number\n&gt; of characters on a team win consistently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Later,\n&gt; Tristan\n&gt; \n&gt; [Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
