I do believe in a maximum amount of time \nbeing frozen and putting some limitations on huch damage can be \ninflicted while time is frozen.  Also, if you keep freezing time, you \nwill end up restarting from strach with the amount of time frozen.  \nYep, I&#39;ve done  that with one character.\n\n2)damn vulnerability to faeries - That is ridiculous.  1 blow from a \nfaerie can knock out a high experience level mage out of commission \nfor over 30 minutes, even at maximum game speed.  The only relief is \nusing heartburst attack or the warp space attack.  I&#39;ll talk about how \nto solve that problem when we get to faeries.\n\nOther\n\n1a)heartburst attack - I&#39;d like some option to limit heartburst to \nattack only one character class.  That could really be advantageous if \ntrying to get lots of experience points and you don&#39;t want to destroy \nthe generator and/or opponent summoner.\n\n1b)heartburst attack - With the same amount of energy used in a \nheartburst attack, I can do a lot more damage with their basic attack. \n The only advantage in using heartburst is taking out faeries and/or \nweaker opponents.\n\n\n"}}
