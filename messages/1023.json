That \nway I\n&gt; &gt; could put a high level mage around, but take away the ability to\n&gt; &gt; freeze time.  Or put a high-level archmage around, and prevent him\n&gt; &gt; from accessing chain-lightning.\n&gt; \n&gt; That would be cool, though I suspect it&#39;d require changes to the \ngame code\n&gt; (read: another patch) as right now the game probably works out what\n&gt; abilities someone has from their level.\n\nYep, that would be something to be done in Gladiator:Beyond Freedom.\n\nSpeaking of which, how&#39;s progress on putting a copy on this group?\n\n\n"}}
