The only way to get\nto them is by using the option to choose exactly the\nlevel number that you want.  I think they&#39;re in the\n80-90 level range (it&#39;s been a looong time since I&#39;ve\nplayed them so I&#39;m not sure).  It&#39;s strange that they\naren&#39;t documented because they&#39;re designed like\ntutorial missions.  Oh, and if they aren&#39;t in the\n80-90 level range then try 800-900 range.. I can&#39;t be\nfor sure certain but I remember stumbling across them\none day.  They were in the original disk based version\nof the game so you might have to get that to try them.\n\n--- alternate_dph &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; are there any other like secret lvls or can i\n&gt; download some from \n&gt;  somewhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Umm, go to the files section of this group and\n&gt; download scenarios to play.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n\t\t\n__________________________________ \nDo you Yahoo!? \nThe all-new My Yahoo! - What will yours do?\nhttp://my.yahoo.com \n\n"}}
