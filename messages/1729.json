I \ncouldn&#39;t say why... it just controls fewer enemies each time. If there \nwere limits on how many enemies could be controlled, and the duration\n were more stable, this could be a useful spell.\n\nI agree.  Also, I&#39;d like to place limits on when it could be used.  If \nthere are 10 or fewer opponents, there isn&#39;t a need for mind-control.\n\n&gt; Summon elemental needs to be downgraded--it&#39;s just too\n powerful!\n\nI&#39;d like a limit to how many fire elementals could be summoned at a \ntime, both an individual limit for each archmage and a team limit.\n\n\n"}}
