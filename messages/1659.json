Hypothetically, you could keep time frozen until you\n&gt; wipe out the entire enemy force, as long as you have sufficient mana.\n&gt;  It gets aggrevating if a friendly mage keeps freezing time when the\n&gt; rest of your team is out of mana.\n\nWell, any time freezing is extremely annoying in multiplayer games. I\nthink htat if Openglad becomes a suitable game for mostly multiplayer\nthings, then the time freezing would have to be either greatly reformed or\ndiminished a lot.\n\n&gt; Barbarians really do need more attacks.\n\nIndeed they do. I liked the list that someone sent in, especially\nbattlecry.\n\n\n"}}
