I could grow to maximum size and switch to using exploding \nbolts without worrying about killing the character for a while.  When \nI get to the smallest size, I just switch back to grow to get back to \nmaximum size.\n\n&gt; Has anyone done any work on a new tile set for the\n&gt; giant skeleton?
