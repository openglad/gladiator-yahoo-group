I only say that to let you all know that \nhaving a tournament would be weeks away, at best.\n\nThe first issue of the tournament would be what scenarios to use.  \nWould we want to use the the built-in scenarios or create a special \nset of scenarios to use for the tournament?  If it is the later, it \nwould probably be until both Tevildo [I&#39;m assuming you would want to \nhelp design those scenarios] and I have finished work on our own \nscenarios.\n\n\n"}}
