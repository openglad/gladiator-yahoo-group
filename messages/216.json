The mage had 500 exp \nlevel and everything else was 1800.  I observed something\ninteresting: \n  After I converted the mage into an archmage, every Fire Elemenal \nsummoned by the archmage had a negative magic power reading and a \nnegative health power reading.  Interestingly enough, the mage could \ncontiniously do heart burst attacks and all hearth burst attacks \ncovered all enemies on a given level.\n\nSince I finally beat my own level, I will be working through all \nexisting levels.  I will try to create some levels designed to work a \nteam up to the point of taking own my extreme level.  Just beware, a \nteam of one cleric (no matter how powerfull) will not be able to \ndefeat all my levels I design.\n\n\n"}}
