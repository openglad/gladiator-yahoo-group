I&#39;m modifying the number of druids, though. \n  One thing puzzles me, though.  I disturbed the druids evenly across \nthe width of the scenario.  But the right side ends almost completely \ncovered in trees, while the left side is scarcely populated with \ntrees.  This is before I use &#39;Taunt&#39; attack to bring the faeries to me \n so I can take most of them out with a single bomb.  Incidently, using \nanchored &#39;Poison Clous&#39; also is a pretty effective means of population \ncontrol (once started with 500+ and by using anchored Poison Clouds \nended up with under 400 opponents).  \n\nThis scenario is indeed working out to be exactly what I want.  Too \nbad, I can&#39;t incorporate it into my legitimate scenarios.  In order to \nmake it work like I wanted it to, I had to isolate the druids from the \nplayer team by lots of water (a definite no-no for legitimate because \n you would have to cheat in order win.)  Wait a minute, I guess I need \nto try to beat it legitimately with a legitimate team (I have only 1 \nlegitimate team.)\n\n\n"}}
