Like when you hold \nattack and \n&gt; throw the fireballs.\n\n&quot;High Priest&quot; is going to be a promotion of Cleric, but I am open to \ncharacters having some choices about what they promote to (Practical \nMage and Archmage would both) as long as all the promoted choices are \nfully stocked with abilities.\n\nI am not complaining.\n\nI was going to start discussion about &quot;High Priest&quot; on Wednesday, and \non either Friday or Saturday bring up &quot;Practical Mage&quot;.  If I think up \n a couple of abilities with another potential promoted class, I&#39;ll \nbring that one up.  I want to do a promotion of druid, because it \nseems so natural (hahahaha).\n\nThe basic attack for an asassin would be throwing a dagger if the \nopponent was a pretty good distance away and for up close it would be \nusing a sword to slash opponents.\n\nWhen we get through this topic, I&#39;ll start work compiling a text \ndocument with the requested changes to characters.  \n\n\n"}}
