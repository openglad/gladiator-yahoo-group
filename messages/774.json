The graphics are great, and I think that the people who\ndid the graphics in G:BF were actually scooped up by Blizzard for\nwork on Diablo 2.\n\n&gt; -changes in charecters to take affect\n\nNot completely sure what you mean.\n\n&gt; -better ai\n\nSomewhat improved, and from a single player&#39;s perspective (though\nmy friend Lonny and I used to spend all night playing Gladiator to its\nbitter end on my 386) greatly improved.  Your team will follow the\ncharacter you&#39;re controlling.\n\n&gt; -ability to change victory conditiones in scenario&#39;s like tev did only\n&gt; without c++\n\nAs far as I know, this is also possible to do in SCEN.EXE that\ncomes with your registered gladiators package.  Things such as\nno NPC death (IE, tic and tac can&#39;t die) upon completion of the\nlevel are possible to do from this, at least I know that much.\n\n&gt; that&#39;s about all I need i&#39;m happy to leave the programmers to decide\n&gt; everything else\n&gt;\n&gt; if programmer&#39;s finish up there test files soon that could bring back\n&gt; descusion. i could also start creating my scenario&#39;s. about the\ntourniment:\n&gt; would you need to be part of gladlist to partake?\n&gt;\n&gt; _,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n&gt; ���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n&gt; -Terry\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [gladiator] Optimal configuration settings\n&gt; Date: Tue, 03 Jul 2001 05:52:53 -0000\n&gt;\n&gt; Ok, this topic is restricted to those of us with modern computers.\n&gt; Just joking.\n&gt;\n&gt; When you right click on the file to run gladiator and then click on\n&gt; properties, what special modifications have you done to make the game\n&gt; run more smoothly?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have changed the following Memory settings:\n&gt; Intial Environment from Auto to 4096\n&gt; Extended Memory from Auto to 4096\n&gt;\n&gt; I have tried changing Extended Memory to higher values, but that\n&gt; always results in the game crashing.  I have also tried changing\n&gt; Conventional Memory but that results in the game crashing.  Changing\n&gt; MS-DOS protected mode memory has also resulted in the game crashing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Are there any other modifications I can do to increase Gladiator&#39;s\n&gt; performance?  I have already closed down almost all my other programs\n&gt; when running gladiator.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, after this topic, there are no new topics avaiable.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
