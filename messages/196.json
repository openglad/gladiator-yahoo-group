With the rush of\npeople\npreparing levels to be released, this is a must.  I&#39;d be happy to maintain some\nkind of a list somewhere on the web that says exactly what levels are taken,\nand where they can be acquired.  Thoughts?\n\nI just figured that with everyone making levels, the overlapping of the numbers\nmight end up being a concern.\n\n-Chris/Shayd\n\nRicky Der wrote:\n\n&gt; Lol, i am a guy My name is Ricky Der, Donna Der is My mother lol just want\n&gt; to clear that up.
