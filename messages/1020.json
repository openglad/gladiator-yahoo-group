Do you ever see ninjas in a fantasy novel? \nNo. That&#39;s because most medieval fantasy novels launch from 12th century \nEurope. Ninjas come from Japan.\nNow, are you talking the funny little japanese guys that run around in black \nclothing, with ninja stars and katanas and in general are amazing fighters, \nthieves and assassins?\nIf you want to be an assassin, (working for the Saervii or for Jakarta) I \nneed a physical description, skills and a general attitude. If you can&#39;t \ngive me more than a 1 sentence answer, I have to make one up.\n\n-Trahern\n\n--\n\n_______________________________________________\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free!\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
