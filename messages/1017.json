The \nonly solution I know of is to delete save0.gtl from the folder where \ngladiator is.  This will erase the current team from memory and allow \nyou to continue the game.  \n\n*I* can crash the game after completing 5-6 scenarios because of \ngetting experience level too high.\n\nNote: that&#39;s why I strongly advise AGAINST anyone trying to continue \nmaking teams too powerfull.  Once you get to experience level 250, \nyour character is powerfull enough.\n\nIf a new scenario editor is developed, I would highly recommend \nputting limits on high how experince level character you can put in a \nscenario.\n\n  Once, the tournament group gets to a certain point, I&#39;ll shift the \n50 project into high gear.  I want a team (more than 4 characters) to \nsend through my own scenarios.\n\n\n"}}
