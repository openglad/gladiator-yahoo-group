I spent about 2 hours trying to beat &quot;The \nBrag&quot;.   The opponent archers kept killing one of my team members with \na single exploding bolt, despite the 3 map tile wide walls. [I knew I \nshould have started earlier in the Tevfifty devoting my earnings \nsololy to strength, intelligence, and armor for my team members \nbefore getting to my own set.]  It ain&#39;t fun when a member of your \nteam can be killed with a single blow.\n\nI may undertake the project of renovating scenario #122 just to add \nmore space between the rows of trees so that the golems stay in place. \n Literally, currently there are 4 vertical map tiles and 4 \nhorizontal map tiles separating each row.  Any ideas on how much more \nspace to add between the rows of trees just to ease the crowded \ngolems?\n\n\n"}}
