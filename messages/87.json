(Ape)\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: &quot;Seth Mitchell&quot; &lt;smitchell@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m thinking it would be cool if we got some kind\n&gt;&gt;&gt; of Gladiator tournament going on.  I&#39;ve written\n&gt;&gt;&gt; out a basic outline of how the rules would work\n&gt;&gt;&gt; on my own, and would be happy to organize it, but\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I need to know if anyone would participate.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The only problem is that multiplayer Gladiator still is not possible\n&gt;&gt;unless it is on the same computer.  This means that only singler-\n&gt;&gt;player touraments are possible.  The problem with that is that\n&gt;&gt;people can cheat in single player mode.\n&gt;\n&gt;Well...as long as we had no prizes or anything I don&#39;t think cheating\nwould\n&gt;be a problem...I mean would be the motivation to cheat for something\nlike\n&gt;this? I think it would be fun, and if no one cheated it would be\ninteresting\n&gt;to see the results.\n&gt;-Maxim\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---\n&gt;           Free Games, Cash Prizes!\n&gt;Gamesville - World&#39;s Biggest Game Show Site!\n&gt;          http://www.onelist.com/ad/0\n&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---\n&gt;The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
