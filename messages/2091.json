For\nexample, the scenario would have characters experience levels set as\n&quot;+2&quot; meaning 2 experience levels higher than the norm or &quot;-2&quot; meaning\n2 experience levels below norm just to give a variation.\n\nI saw where you guys wanted to produce a scenario that showed off the\nfeatures of Open Gladiator: Enhanced.  Frankly, I think it should be a\nset of scenarios to show off the new features, each one showing off\none particular new feature.\n\nI never quite found the code where it spells out how strong each\nattack is.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s some really complicated formula.\n\n\n"}}
