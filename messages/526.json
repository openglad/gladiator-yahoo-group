It \ntakes 1 year of NOT checking most free email accounts for an account \nto be deleted.  Trust me, I have tried to delete an old hotmail \naccount of mine.\n\nIf I get no response from an email address without a message about the \nemail address not existing, it stays.  I will not start this \nverification process for a while so don&#39;t start worrying.\n\nI will start my verification process with those who do not receive \nemail from this group, but only check by visiting the website.\n\nThis is about 1)checking email addresses and 2)spreading news about a \npotential Gladiator tournament.\n\nBTW, last month was a record setter for number of messages posted to \nthis group.\n\n\n"}}
