I am serious about limits to prevent omnipotent\n&gt;characters.  2nd, I beat the ocean by freezing time with my mage.  I\n&gt;still have not figured how that worked.  3rd, my mega-archmage can\n&gt;summon fire elementals that can not be harmed.  Theoritically, I could\n&gt;continously teleport and be unharmed in the ocean until I find one\n&gt;spot to land.\n\nWith JUST a mage? I checked, and no mage, no matter what level, has the \nheartbursting range to take out the hidden stuff. There is no room to \nteleport to it, and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s out of chain lightning range. Maybe \na very high-level ghost could get the hits in, but I wouldn&#39;t bet on it.\n-T.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
