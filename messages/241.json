I want the scenario to run without error messages.\n\nHmm .. in general, that means you have object acting illegally once the \nscenario starts .. that is, you put down something weird in the scenario \neditor (like a thrown weapon) .. during game-play, the weapon or whatever \ngets confused (&quot;who threw me?&quot; &quot;do I have a target?&quot; &quot;how long do I live \nfor before vanishing?&quot; etc.) and starts spewing error messages.\n\nAre you sure the value you get is 44? I can&#39;t find anything specific to \nmatch up against that .. in general, the numeric codes for the weapons are:\n\n         FAMILY_KNIFE 0\n         FAMILY_ROCK 1\n         FAMILY_ARROW 2\n         FAMILY_FIREBALL 3\n         FAMILY_TREE 4\n         FAMILY_METEOR 5\n         FAMILY_SPRINKLE 6\n         FAMILY_BONE 7\n         FAMILY_BLOOD 8\n         FAMILY_BLOB 9\n         FAMILY_FIRE_ARROW 10\n         FAMILY_LIGHTNING 11\n         FAMILY_GLOW 12\n         FAMILY_WAVE 13\n         FAMILY_WAVE2 14\n         FAMILY_WAVE3 15\n         FAMILY_CIRCLE_PROTECTION 16\n         FAMILY_HAMMER 17\n         FAMILY_DOOR 18\n         FAMILY_BOULDER 19\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
