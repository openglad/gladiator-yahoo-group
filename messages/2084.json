I&#39;m looking for a . .  guinea pi . . . beta tester for a\nprogram  I&#39;ve written that functions similiarly to &quot;Boost&quot;.  I call\nthe program &quot;Trickster&#39;s Boost&quot;, for reasons that will become . .\nobvious to any users of said program.  It assumes you are using a\nsaved game file from the registered version.  \n\nIt should run under Windows and on my home pc, it &#39;behaves&#39;\nappropriately.  I used VB&#39;s &quot;Make exe&quot; command and I am wanting to see\nif any additional files are needed for it to run properly.\n\nAnd yes, I know how to detect if my program is used any gladiator\ntournament.\n\nIf anybody will email me privately, I&#39;ll send you the file.  If the\nprogram doesn&#39;t run, I need to know which files it said it was missing.\n\n* * * \n\nOk, what specifically can the program do?\n\nLet&#39;s see . . \n\n1)Reset scenario status so you can play the same scenario repeatedly\nafter obtaining victory each time\n\n2)Reset the amount of cash to give you the maximum amount of cash\n\n3)Boost character stats up to what I believe are the best possible.\n(we&#39;re talking about an experience level 500 character and mana\nrecharges completely immediately after using most attacks unless time\nis frozen, the strongest possible attacks of any character, fastest\npossible speed for any character - ie. if this character can&#39;t defeat\nthe scenario, then it&#39;s impossible for any hired character of that\ntype to defeat said scenario)\n\n\n"}}
