Also, at \n&gt; high experience levels, it&#39;s impossible for skeleton to use any \nmana \n&gt; for either tunnel or it&#39;s basic attack.\n\nSeems OK, that sort of thing happens to every class when they become \nmighty enough.\n \n&gt; Also, there should be some limits on a ghost&#39;s ability to scare \n&gt; characters.  There should be a point where a level 20 \nghost&#39;s &quot;scare&quot; \n&gt; attack has a minimal effect on a level 50+ character.  Also, ghosts \n&gt; should have a stronger immunity to their own attack.\n\nOr maybe, stop scare-effect growth at a certain point, but at that \nexact point introduce a new ability for the ghost.\n\n&gt; When you have the choice of raising a skeleton or raising a ghost, \n&gt; which one do you raise?\n\nI never have either as a permanent team member...\n\n\n"}}
