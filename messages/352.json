A majority of the levels out there are\ndesigned for high-level teams that, apparently, you need\nto have played the game out in full and developed an\neffective team.\n\nWhy is this a problem?  I&#39;m sure many of you on this\nlist will agree with me when I say that the most\nenjoyable part of Glad is creating your beginning team\nwhich may consist of any number of useful entities\n(druids, my favorite class, are especially fun early\non!).  Playing a team that you have already played to\ndeath in other scenarios is not as much fun in my\nhumble opinion.\n\nMy proposition is that the builders out there make\nlevels that can be played by a brand new team.  Make a\nchain of scenarios that start easy (as in level 1 easy)\nand build up to a plot.  Is this not the most fun thing\nabout Gladiator?\n\nSure, developing your character to maximum-power is a\nlot of fun as well, but I prefer the fun of hiring five\nsoldiers for fodder and running them at the enemy while\nyour main characters gain experience in more creative\nways.\n\nThoughts?\n\n  --moontug\n    http://plaza.v-wave.com/moontug/\n\n\n"}}
