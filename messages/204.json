The first mage to\nreach \n the point of being able to be converted into an archmage would \nchanged into an archmage.  The purpose of the elf is to collect \ngold/silver that other characters can not reach.\n\nIf I was starting from scratch and minimally cheating with money, I \nwould start with a level 13 archmage, a level 13 mage, and 2 level 10 \nclerics.  This team can take on any level no matter how difficult.  \nLet me explain the purpose of each member of the team:\n\nThe 2 level 10 clerics - raise extra ghosts and skeletons to handle \nlarge numbers of opposition\n\nThe level 13 archmage - summon images and fire elementals to handle \nlarge numbers of opposition plus the chain lightning to  handle \nmultiple problems\n\nThe level 13 mage - freeze time to help handle overwhelming numbers.  \nParticularly usefull when dealing with large numbers of slime that \nkeep multiplying.\n\nI could design a level that no cleric would be able to beat without \nhelp from pre-existing ghosts or mages/archmages.  The smallest team\nI \nwould go with is one archmage.  The 2nd smallest is one archmage and \none cleric.  The 3rd smallest is one archmage and 2 clerics.  The 4th \nsmallest is the aformentioned 1 archmage, 1 mage, and 2 clerics.\n\nI find it usefull when I have completed a scenario to raise a ghost\nto \n pick up all gold/silver anywhere on the scenario in a hurry.  Am I \nthe only way to do this?\n\nBtw, people before sending out email asking for more scenarios,\nplease \ncheck recent posts to see if anyone has released new scenarios \nrecently (and yes, someone has).\n\n\n"}}
