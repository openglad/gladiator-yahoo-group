For \none thing, it&#39;s a linearly told story: you go here, you go there, you \ndo this, you do that.  What made the built-in campaign (BIC) for \nGladiator so fun, though, was the sense of exploration: which is the \nbest path to take?  Do I need to level up a bit before I can clear \nthis area?\n\nThe BIC still had an overarching narrative: hunt-down and kill \nJakarta.  Within this, you had several sub-plots: Carl the Druid and \nthe evil magic-users, the undead fighting the slimes, Cenweith Manor, \netc.  Each one of these plots was linear (more or less), so you still \ngot some story told.\n\nSo my first beef would be the linearity issue.  The second is that a \nlot of the levels have premises that may come off strangely: one \nthird of your army has turned -- presumably this doesn&#39;t mean your \nsquad (since you can&#39;t actually steal people from the squad), but if \nit means simply your NPC forces, then the level will probably wind up \nbeing pretty easy (2/3 of your forces + you vs. 1/3).\n\nGenerally, I think NPCs only work as cannon fodder -- or so it seemed \nplaying the BIC.\n\n- Mark\n\n\n"}}
