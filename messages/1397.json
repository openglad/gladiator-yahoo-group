I&#39;m not a C++ programmer (Only VB), so I can&#39;t help\n&gt; in that section, but I&#39;m pretty good at drawing graphics and the like,\n&gt; so if there is anything that could use drawing, gimmie a ring.\n&gt;\n&gt; Alright, another VB programmer.  I am working off and on on a scenario\n&gt; editor in VB.  I have most of the functionality worked out (add\n&gt; objects, deleting objects, modifying objects), but I just haven&#39;t put\n&gt; together the means of selection.  Right now, the only way I can do\n&gt; that is by going inside my code and manually putting that in.  Would\n&gt; you like me to email you all that I have put together for my scenario\n&gt; editor?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
