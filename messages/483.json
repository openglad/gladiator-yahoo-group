There&#39;s\nsome other things about it but I haven&#39;t read it in a while.  I think\nthe folks at FSGames would probably rather see the game finished than\nnot, so if they aren&#39;t really going to finish it, as seems to be the\ncase (but maybe I&#39;m wrong) maybe they wouldn&#39;t feel to bad about letting\nthe comunity take a crack at it.  One thing that&#39;s too bad though is I\nthink most open source stuff is written for the gnu compiler which is\nalso free and comes with any linux distribution.  But since this is a\nwindows game the code is for a commercial compiler I&#39;m sure, which would\nlimit the group of people that could work on it to who has, or can\nafford the compiler(or who can warez it. . )\n\nSeth Mitchell wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m still around, though I&#39;m not from FS Games.  Unfortunately, for about 10\n&gt; weeks, starting May 30, I&#39;ll be in Great Lakes, Illinois learning about\n&gt; attention to detail and how to wake up at the crack of dawn.  Go Navy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Releasing the source code would be neat, although I don&#39;t know how Tom would\n&gt; feel about that, nor do I know about the legal issues associated with that,\n&gt; if any.\n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
