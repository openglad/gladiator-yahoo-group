Right now, \nclerics have an instant death attack against both ghosts and \nskeletons, but there&#39;s a balance to go with it.\n \n&gt; though because if computer AI is improved, say then you have an \n impossible level XX Assasin to kill, the levels could become near \nimpossible.\n\nI disagree with giving a cloaked character the ability to kill \ncharacters with a single attack.  The problem is you couldn&#39;t protect \nyour troops well enough and the assasin overall has plenty of ways to \ndamage characters.\n\n&gt; I think create blackhole should gravitate people towards \n it and hurt them at a constant rate when they approach the center. \n\nThis is where I disagree strongly.  Aside from basic attack and black \nhole, the rest of a practical mage&#39;s abilities are about assisting \ncharacters in a battle.  A really powerfull attack is needed to \nbalance out the character and using black hole to kill characters \nmakes logic sense, especially since the black hole kills both \nteammates and opponents.  Besides that, a black hole would be a \nconstant drain on the practical mage&#39;s mana and when the practical \nmage runs out of mana, the black hole disappears.\n\nAs usual, it&#39;s ok to disagree.\n\n\n"}}
