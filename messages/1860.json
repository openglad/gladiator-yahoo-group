However, I need to know which scenarios would be good ones \nto test it out on.  (I&#39;ve already tested it on the brag, #116).  I&#39;ve \nalready attached a couple of extra functions to the program: a map \ndecoder (I&#39;m going to work on the output) and a map copier (always \nnice).\n\nOnce I get the output for the decoder to my enjoyment, I&#39;ll work on \nadding an encoder function. (An encoder function without a smooth \nprogram is utterly stupid).\n\n\n"}}
