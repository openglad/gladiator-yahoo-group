Although the version number has only\nincremented by .05, there have been a whole lot of improvements. Here&#39;s a\nsummary:\n\n1. Sean implemented a new way to do pixel doubling, and the graphics look\nmuch much better (and less pixilated) now.\n2. Several megs of memory leaks were fixed.\n3. The game now finds files easier.\n4. Its now much easier to compile and install Openglad on any unix-based\nsystem.\n5. Some fading code was donated so all features are implemented now.\n6. Countless bugs were fixed. The game is now rock-solid.\n\n0.95 was released about 20 minutes ago. Only the source was released\ntoday, but as I said, its very easy to compile on any unix-ish OS (Linux,\nFreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc...). There were some weird issues with Windows last\ntime I tried to compile it on that platform, so windows binaries might\ntake a little while. If anyone wants to help with that, they&#39;re more than\nwelcome to.\n\nThe source also ships with utilities for editing pixie files and packing\nthe .001&#39;s. I&#39;ll release those as binaries when the other binaries are\nreleased.\n\n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of right now. If I remember anything else, I&#39;ll\nsend another email off.\n\nThanks to everyone who made this possible, the Open Source community, and\nFSGames.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
