It was hard and after trying to exit the level\nwhen winning, my elf jumped from experience level 500 to 524 and\ntrashed the game.\n\nMy elf had interesting properties:\n\n1)no matter what attack I used, I couldn&#39;t run out of mana.  Even\nusing the forest walk ability in a forest, only by using the most\npowerfull attack was I able to barely drain off any of my mana.\n\n2)it could outrun its own attacks. :-(\n\n3)Since I had a virtually infinite amount of mana, I was able to use\nthe most advanced attack to create a barrier of protection by having\nthe rocks bounce off walls.  Of course, the most powerfull attack was\nusing the most advanced was running away from my opponent, while\nfiring, until I ran into a wall and then changing direction to run\ninto my opponent.  This combined on-slaught can quickly demolish most\nmy opponents, making it one of my favorite maneuvers with an elf.\n\nDo I hear any other .. . unusual attacks . . that somebody has\nemployed to beat a scenario?\n\n\n"}}
