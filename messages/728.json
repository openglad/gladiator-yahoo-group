The whole point of halfings is\ncreating stronger characters.  If you really want to get technical,\nbanning half clerics is more effective.  It is way too easy for\nclerics to accumulate experience (using &#39;heal&#39;) and and any other\ncharacter equipped with that ability, would have no trouble gaining\nlots of experience really quick.\n\n &gt; don&#39;t you think 20&#39;s too steep? people will never use there\ncharecters\n\nWhat would you propose?  experience level 15?  The idea is you&#39;ve\nreached a point where you&#39;ve maxed out on using both character&#39;s\nabilities individually and you want to progress.  One character [I\nforgot which one] requires you to reach experience level 12 before you\nget access to all  abilites.  I want some point a few steps further\nthan that before allowing the creation of halfings.  By requiring a\nhigher experience level for halfings, it should make some people think\ntwice before creating a halfing.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
