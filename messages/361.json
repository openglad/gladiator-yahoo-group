After I copied save0.gtl, the game refused to run.  \nSo I deleted the file and added the rest of my save game files and \npresto, the game ran in a different folder.  So I went back to my \noriginal folder and deleted save0.gtl.  Apparantly that file holds the \n temporary state of whatever team played last.\n\nI decided to start from stratch and create a new mega-archmage for \nmyself and this time, I will not spend money beyond what I spent on \ncon, str, dex, int, and armor.  Instead, I will those stats alone and \njust raise the experience level.\n\nBy the way, what are the stats [str, con, dex, int, armor] for the \ngeneric characters placed in the game?  I know mages/archmages must \nhave intelligence beyond 75 (even level 1 enemy mages can leave a \nteleport marker).\n\n\n"}}
