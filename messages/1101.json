We always played it as a Gauntlet game -- each one \nof us took one character and played it through.  Usually we did \nCleric, Soldier, Mage, but we mixed it up a fair bit.\n\nAnyway, playing it through that way, a few issues come up:\n\n1) Has anyone else noticed that raise dead is grossly unfair?  Once \nyou get it as a cleric, stages become farcical, and your level sky-\nrockets.\n\n2) Is there any point to whirl and disasrm?  There is a \n(questionable) value to boomerang, once you have a ton of MP, but \ncharge is clearly the best soldier ability.\n\n3) Do resurrect and eat corpse even work?\n\n4) Are ghosts as ludicrously powerful in &quot;army v. army&quot; style play as \nthey are in &quot;heroes v. army&quot;?  As it currently stands, if a ghost \ncatches one of us in a corner, it&#39;s just escape, restart, because \nthere&#39;s no hope of ever getting unscared.  Seems foolish, so I can&#39;t \nimagine it&#39;s that way if you play &quot;properly.&quot;\n\n5) Anyone noticed that if you lose a level, leave it, and come back \nmuch later, it will be beaten?\n\n6) Why is Centweith Manor so difficult relative to every other level \nin the game, when it&#39;s ostensibly a &quot;side-quest&quot; on your way to \nkilling Jakarta?  Am I missing something about how you&#39;re supposed to \nplay it?\n\n7) What exactly do the various stats do?  Especially dexterity, which \ndoesn&#39;t seem to change walking speed very much; the others have \ntheir &quot;obvious&quot; effects -- more MP, more HP, less damage taken, more \ndamage inflicted -- but does intelligence effect spells?  Etc.\n\n8) Why are elvish rock-throwing attacks so damned powerful in certain \nlevels?\n\n---\n\nAnyway, my larger questions are:\n\n1) Is Gladiator still being updated in any fashion?\n\n2) Is there any way to patch the game to add new classes, or to make \nthe classes more interesting?  Right now, the Mage is really the only \none who gets increasingly complex as you level up.\n\n3) Are there any GOOD fan-made scenarios?  I didn&#39;t like Tryx much...\n\nThanks,\nMark\n\n\n"}}
