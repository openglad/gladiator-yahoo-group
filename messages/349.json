Hang on, are there such things? Is there a way you\ncan make it so if a certain NPC dies, the level ends in failure for your\nteam? Or is an unnoficial rule that if that character dies, you have to\nquit?\n&gt; On slaughter, Troy and Commander really went down to Dirk, Kyle and James.\nThankfully they somehow regenerated after each level :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Well I took both of your suggestions.\n&gt; First of all, I downloaded the Tevfifty (right?) levels. Well they sure\nseem hard enough, however I&#39;m kind of disappointed with the lack of detail\nyou put into the maps. And why do you choose hordes of weak lvl guys instead\nof some tough guys? (Don&#39;t take it personally I&#39;m just asking)\n&gt; Second, I tried to make some of my own levels. I think I did a good job on\nthe map detail, and the plot could really go somewhere, however so far it is\na set story, so you have to play the levels in order.\n&gt; But I need to know: which numbers are good to use. Right now Im using lvl\n50, 51 and 52.\n&gt; And how tough should i make it? Right now you&#39;re fighting baddies on lvl\n4 - 7. If you think it should be harder, speak up. I tested this map with my\nlvl 14 archer on battle and he had a tough time.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Trahern\n&gt;\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Get free personalized email at http://www.iname.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
