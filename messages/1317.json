If a \ncharacter has a maximum of 10,000 units of mana or more, this mode \nwould define most (wouldn&#39;t effect the creation of new characters) \nattacks as percentages of available mana.  This would leave to much \nmore powerfull attacks.  The downside of this is using &quot;high energy \nmode&quot; attacks against characters with spells of protections around \nthem because that is very wastefull of mana to do damage (in hand to \nhand combat, an archmage fairs very poorly against characters with \nspells of protection around them, but has no problems against regular \ncharacters).\n\n\n"}}
