I could send you two scenarios: The first one is \nlegendary &quot;The Bonus&quot; to buy the character.  The two one contains \ntents and potions to help you defeat it.  Use the first scenario to \nbuy whichever one first and write down the stats.  Then take it \nthrough the 2nd scenario.  Start over with the 1st one and use it to \nbuy the other character with the same stats and go through the 2nd \nscenario.  I promise you the solder will run out of magical energy \nbefore it destroys one tent.\n \n&gt; elves aren&#39;t perfect to me because of the similarities of their \n&gt; attacks. not to mention they are slow as molasses.\n\nI would like to point that characters who are &quot;slow as molasses&quot; have \nan easier time using teleporters than characters who are &quot;faster than \nlight&quot;, but that&#39;s a discussion for another time.\n\n\n"}}
