Hang on, are there such things? Is there a way you \ncan make it so if a certain NPC dies, the level ends in failure for your \nteam? Or is an unnoficial rule that if that character dies, you have to \nquit?&gt;&gt;\n\nYes, in Scen.exe you can access the level properties by hitting asterisk, \nand specify whether you need to kill everything on a level, kill all \ngenerators, keep the NPCs alive, etc. There&#39;s also a level difficulty rating \nthat you can specify, but I&#39;ve experimented with it and it doesn&#39;t seem to \naffect anything.\n\n&lt;&lt;Well I took both of your suggestions. First of all, I downloaded the \nTevfifty (right?) levels. Well they sure seem hard enough, however I&#39;m kind \nof disappointed with the lack of detail you put into the maps. And why do \nyou choose hordes of weak lvl guys instead of some tough guys? (Don&#39;t take \nit personally I&#39;m just asking)&gt;&gt;\n\nI thought the maps were pretty good. I strive for realism (a tall order in \nthis game), and what&#39;s more real than grass on the plains, trees in the \nforests, water in the ocean, etc.? What else do you want? Let me tell you, \nsome of those levels, like the Labyrinth, were damn hard to make, and I&#39;m \njustly proud of them. And as for the enemies... if I was an overlord and I \nwanted to wipe out an invading army, would I summon my soldiers and have \nthem attack as a unit, or would I get Jimmy Olsen&#39;s signal watch and summon \nSuperman to save the day? I can&#39;t think of many situations in which a single \nperson would be more effective in combat than an army. I take it you haven&#39;t \ngotten very far yet... there are some NASTY enemy NPCs later on. Derrida is \ngoing to kill you at least twice, I guarantee it. Unless you&#39;re playing on \nSkirmish with a DPH-style cadre of demigods, that is... and where&#39;s the fun \nin that?\n\n&lt;&lt;Second, I tried to make some of my own levels. I think I did a good job on \nthe map detail, and the plot could really go somewhere, however so far it is \na set story, so you have to play the levels in order. But I need to know: \nwhich numbers are good to use. Right now Im using lvl 50, 51 and 52. And how \ntough should i make it? Right now you&#39;re fighting baddies on lvl 4 - 7. If \nyou think it should be harder, speak up. I tested this map with my lvl 14 \narcher on battle and he had a tough time.&gt;&gt;\n\nYou&#39;ll have to specify what you mean about the map detail... there are a \nvery limited number of map tiles available to us, and it&#39;s hard to achieve \ncertain effects with them. I had to manually create new column tiles for \nsome of my stuff, and I&#39;m still not satisfied with the up-stairs down-stairs \nconvention I had to use. I believe Ricky Der is using the levels up to 100, \nso you should probably pick again. Oh, now might be a good time to let \npeople know that some levels are included in Levels.001 and can&#39;t be \noverwritten--levels 61, 80-84, 88, and 99... Easy enough to work around, \nassuming you know they&#39;re there. I don&#39;t know why it isn&#39;t said in the help \nfiles that there is a gameplay tutorial starting at level 80. It might have \nhelped people a bunch. Level 61 uses map tiles with numbers beyond the upper \nlimit, so it won&#39;t run, which is a shame, because it seemed to have a nice \nstory to it. Here&#39;s what I was able to recover: &quot;Welcome to Gladiator \nVersion 3 PRESS F1 TO GET HELP WHILE IN the game.  The help page \nwilldescribe the keys used in the game.  This text will be used at the \nbeginning of each scenario to let you know where you are and what you should \nbe DOING. WE PICK UP A SAMPLE ADVENTURE IN THE MIDDLE. JOURNAL ENTRY 61: IT \nIS SAID THAT THE WITCH CASSANDRA WAS BURIED BENEATH THE TEMPLE SHE \nMINISTERED OVER IN THE WASTELAND VALLEY. AS A CHILD, I HEARD MANY LEGENDS OF \nTHE WITCH&#39;S TEMPLE, AND NOW I STAND READY TO RISK OUR LIVES TO CONFIRM THEM. \nI PRAY THEY BE FALSE. OUR SCOUTS REPORT THAT A FIST OF KULLAN&#39;S FORCES ARE \nALREADY IN THE PROCESS OF SECURING THE WITCH&#39;S TOMB. KULLAN HIMSELF WILL \nARRIVE SOON. I DO NOT RELISH THE IDEA OF THROWING MY LIFE AWAY ON SELFLESS \nACTS, BUT IF THE LEGENDS ARE TRUE, THE REPERCUSSIONS WOULD BE UNIMAGINABLE. \nIF THE ARTIFACT LIES BY CASSANDRA&#39;S SIDE WITHIN THE BARREN TEMPLE, IT CANNOT \nFALL INTO KULLAN&#39;S HANDS. IF SO, ALL HOPE IS LOST . . . . FOR ALL OF US. WE \nMOVE HESITANTLY INTO THE WASTELAND VALLEY.&quot; I think level 88 was designed as \na way to get a whole lot of money before starting in the regular levels, and \nlevel 99 was just some junk that got included for no real reason. That&#39;s all \nfor now...\n   -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
