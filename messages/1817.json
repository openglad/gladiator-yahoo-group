My team members attack \nanything, regardless of level, virtually ignore yell and protect \norders, and scatter themselves everywhere. \n\nI agree.  I had to use &quot;yo&quot; repeatedly during &quot;the Slime King&quot; just to \nget to the point of reaching the opponent slime.  Honestly, at times, \nI really wish I could turn off my team&#39;s x-ray vision.\n\n&gt;It&#39;s extraordinarily hard to make them act as a unit, unless I play \nat slow speeds and alternate between each character, dragging each\n one out of danger in turn.\n\nThe easiest times I had with &quot;Tic and Tac&quot; were on those rare \noccassions when my team acted like a team.\n\n&gt;At this level of AI, it&#39;s easiest to play a team of one.\n\nHehe, it&#39;s almost mission impossible to complete &quot;Yet Even More \nHedges&quot; with a one man team because of all the faeries.\n\nI can play with a team of 5, but I have to stop every 30 seconds or so \nto access the menu to see how the rest of my team&#39;s health is.\n\nIt&#39;s really frustrating because during my hedge scenarios, either I \ncontrolled my elf or my elf gets killed.\n\nThat&#39;s one of the reasons I really like the idea of being able to \nchoose which members of your team complete each scenario.  That way I \ncould have the benefits of large teams and small teams.  If I put a \nthief and an elf on the same time and go through a scneario with lots \nof forested areas, I would hope my thief wouldn&#39;t kill the rest of the \nteam while I navigate the elf through the scenario.\n\n\n"}}
