Giving them \ntelekinetic abilities would be a start.  I do believe that towers \nshould be able to &#39;activate&#39; other team members to summon them to the \nposition to prevent sneak attacks.  The other thing that would be cool \n for is if there was an attack that went in multiple directions.\n\n&gt;as for golems, they get mad strong at higher levels \n&gt; with their exploding boulders and whatnot but they still can&#39;t move \n&gt; around so good, which could be a problem (Labyrinth). so, what to \ndo. i say remove golems as they can&#39;t work good and keep towers as \nthey can.\n\n\nActually, golems can be quite usefull as guardians if they had decent \nattacks and a fair amount of space to move around in.  I would propose \ngiving them an attack of &quot;Rolling ball&quot;.  Activating this attack would \nallow to roll over opponents (or trees) to cause damage.  The \nalternate would be &quot;Return to normal&quot;, which return the Golem to \nnormal.\n\n\n"}}
