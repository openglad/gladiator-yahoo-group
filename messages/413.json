I have problem detecting \nonline sacarism.\n\nHmm.  If I remind people why they need to go through Tevildo&#39;s \nscenarios first, you might accuse of something else.  If I do not \nremind people, well, nothing happens because there is a built in \nreminder when people download my scenarios.  I, also, think Tevildo \nbest indirectly explained why they should go through his scenarios \nfirst.\n\nBTW, soldiers, archers, druids, elves, fire elementals, barbarians, \norcs, orc captains, clerics, and possibly mage-oriented scenarios are \non my list.  What kind of maps do people think would be the best for \neach character?\n\nYep, I have finished my first new scenario this year.  The next one \nwill take a long time to build because it centers around the theme of \n&#39;the weakest link in a chain determines the strength of the entire \nchain&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
