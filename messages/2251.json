I added a &quot;Goto&quot; record number\nbutton =\r\nand put a checkbox for displaying images as a workaround for\nthe tga file p=\r\nroblem.  As long as the button remains unchecked, you\nwon&#39;t get a preview o=\r\nf the image, but you can add tga files (Or change\nthe folder name to one th=\r\nat has the tga files :-).)  Oh yea, the\ndelete won&#39;t work.\n\n&gt; I still got t=\r\no write some more code to store how the current\nsmoother program works and =\r\nsave it.  (Entering the data for the\nsmoother rules won&#39;t be near as bad as=\r\n entering the data for all the\nmap tiles; the rules are all in one place ve=\r\nrsus the data for the map\ntiles being scattered all over the place.)\n\nYou g=\r\nuys saw the html files I created.  Right now, priority #1 for me\nis compili=\r\nng James the right way and then work on a way to store the\nrules for smooth=\r\ning tiles out in a data file so I don&#39;t have to\nrecompile my code every tim=\r\ne we want to change the smoother rules out.\n I could fairly easily copy the=\r\n code out that Iused to smooth tiles on\na map and adapt it for the current =\r\nprogram, but that&#39;s not what Jesse\nv.02 is about.  Jesse v.02 is about buil=\r\nding flexibility into the code\nthat I have.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
