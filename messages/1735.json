(Btw, \nthat does puzzle me.  Why can&#39;t character leave an anchored poison \ncloud?)  Besides that, I have yet to create a thief who can leave a \ntrail of bombs throughout an entire scenario without either killing \nhimself or running out of mana.  This business of running around like \na chicken with its head cut off shouldn&#39;t be too rampant with thieves. \n By george if they can summon a bomb that powerfull, they shouldn&#39;t be \nterrified for 10 seconds after it explodes.  [Also, thief and 2 \nclerics combination yields a very good way to build up experience \npoints for a cleric without risking death to the cleric]\n\n&gt; Orc commanders should get upgraded Orc abilities, plus\n giving a boost to all nearby &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;magic&quot; creatures. Oh, and \nyelling for help should actually work ; P\n\nI&#39;d favor the presence of an orc captain giving nearby orcs a raise in \nthe amount of damage done and dodging ability.  Also, I&#39;d favor a \n&quot;Summon formation&quot; attack by orc captains.  The effect would be \nstronger than &quot;yo&quot;.  I would propose giving them the ability to walk \non water and the ability to throw a net over an opponent which would \ndisable an opponent&#39;s attacks until the net was destroyed.\n\n\n"}}
