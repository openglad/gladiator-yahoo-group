I crashed Gladiator again.\nI had the following stats for my mega-archmage:\nstr 139\ndex 141\ncon 139\nint 151\narm 140\nAt what experience level, do the following stats cause the game to \ncrash?  Why is that I can play against experience level 4000 slime \nwithout crashing the game, but everytime my character crosses over \nexperience level 500, the game crashes?\n\nBy the way, I have discovered that a grid too big crashes the scenario \n level editor and the game.  In other news, I created a scenario with \nenough gold to give a player 1.6 billion dollars.  It takes a while \nfor that scenario to load, though.\n\nIn case you were wondering, I went from experience level 270 to \nexperience level 572 in one scenario, fighting experience level 1000 \nslime at skirmish.  Of course, I had some potions of magic, flight, \ninvulnerability, invisibility, and speed to assist me.\n\nWill someone from FSGames please respond to this message?\n\n\n"}}
