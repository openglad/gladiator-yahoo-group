[I&#39;m going \nto try to get the page on elves put up pretty soon]\n\nThis week we are evaluating slime.\n\nI believe slime are the ultimate defensive character in the game, with \nthem growing right back almost as soon as knock them down a size \n(never quite able to pull that feat while controlling a slime.).\n\nAdmittedly, I do think slime should have a few more abilities: combine \n(heck if two slime can split, why can&#39;t they combine to form a more \npowerfull slime), shrink (that way slime don&#39;t have to divide to go \nthrough a passage if it&#39;s too narrow), a corrosive acid attack, and \nmaybe a &quot;digest&quot; attack (if your character is completed surrounded by \nslime and relatively weak compared to slime, they may be able to \n&quot;digest&quot; your character and kill it).\n\nAdmittedly, I would like it relisted attacks for slime:\n1)grow with alternate of shrink\n2)split with alternate of combine\n3)corrosive acid with alternate of digest\n\n\n"}}
