Actually, there was a series of such discs full of \nShareware, but I forgot what they were called. I discovered that CRPGs \ncould be fun, and I also discovered that Abuse was really freaking \nhard.\n\nWith my 3&#39;6&quot; height and 386 computer, I played Gladiator. I discovered \nthat it was actually pretty fun! Unfortunately, it was Shareware, and \nby now, at least 500 different games of Shareware had tantalized me \nwith &quot;REGISTER NOW!&quot; And my dad didn&#39;t want to pay for about 500 \ndifferent games.\n\nMuch later, when I was about 4&#39;6&quot;, and a 36.4k connection was the \nfastest around, I discovered FSGames&#39; website. I was like, &quot;OMG ITS \nGLADIATOR&quot; and was overjoyed. But still, they wanted registration. I \ndid, however, download and play the Win95 alpha.\n\nI visited FSGames once again with a DSL connection. I now had a credit \ncard, so I figured that it wouldn&#39;t hurt to spend about $10 on a game \nthat I remembered was one of the best games I ever played. By then, I \nwas also playing things like Infantry Zone (http://www.infantryzone.\ncom), Liero, and Starcraft, but that didn&#39;t stop me from enjoying such \nan old game. While I was at it, I also looked up the old Excelsior \nPhase One: Lysandia game and the Ultizurk series.\n\nFinally, I ended up deciding to look at http://www.fsgames.com again. \nBut the website was gone! I typed +&quot;gladiator&quot; +&quot;forgotten sages&quot; into \nYahoo and found this mailing list. This was about a few days ago. I&#39;ve \nalso come across the OpenGlad project.\n\nHello everybody.\n\n\n\n"}}
