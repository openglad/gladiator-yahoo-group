My programming might be kinda\nrusty\n&gt; though. It would probably be good if we could use java, because it&#39;s\n&gt; fairly simple and has free compiler and developement kit. either\nthat or\n&gt; the GNU C compiler, again because it&#39;s free,  though more\ncomplicated\n&gt; than java I think.\n\nPersonally, I rather have it redone in either Visual Basic or Visual\nC/C++.  That would be the easiest way to have it more mouse-oriented.\n\n&gt;  I have a feeling the format is not overly\ncomplex\n&gt; and someone that knew what they were doing could probably figgure it\n&gt; out,  but that would take quite a bit of work.  it would be\ninteresing\n&gt; to try and figgure out but I do have a summer vacation to enjoy and\n&gt; several other prodjects (mostly linux stuff) that I&#39;m working on ;)\n\n  Either way, I am going to ask for the 411 on the the file formats\nused to contain scenarios.  I would love to have a single file that\ncould hold all the scenarios in a collection.\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
