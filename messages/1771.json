All people planning on designing a scenario around the\n&gt; theme would be need to let the group know by May 18 and the scenario\n&gt; files would have to be uploaded into the group folder called &quot;contest\n&gt; scenarios&quot; by June 7.  The following week, a poll be conducted to\n&gt; determine who designed the best scenario.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
