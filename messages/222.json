The special ended up in the millions.  I estimate it \nwill take at least a level 50 archmage and a couple of level 40 \nclerics to be able to win.\n\nTo that end, I will be designing levels that give lots of experience \nand at least $1,000,000 in treasure.\n\nIf we are going to have so many levels, should not somebody try to\ntie \nthem together in as few zip files as possible?\n\n\n"}}
