This would occur when a character gets \nsomewhere between 1 million and 10 million experience points.  At that \npoint in the game, the character would get bonuses.  One being having \naccess to one potion of everything with a thought once per scenario.\n\nAny way, at the point of becoming an md, the scale starts back at 1, \nbut it&#39;s extremely difficult (more so than normally gaining higher \nexperience levels) to climb up that ladder.  Also, to make it clear, \nit should not be possible to place an md in any scenario.\n\nWith the curteousy of scenario #401 and other scenarios from my \ntortured set, it&#39;s impossible in the current game to boost a soldier \nbeyond level 200 without crashing the game.  Yet, I can bring a mage \nup to level 500 without crashing the game.  [Note: one reason I want \nmds is just to put a cap on max normal experience level for \ncharacters.]\n\n\n"}}
