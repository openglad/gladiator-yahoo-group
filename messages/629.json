It is very \ntricky to beat that scenario with a mage or achmage, even if either \ncharacter has experience level above 100.  In fact, one of the ironies \nof this scenario is it harder because the elves can&#39;t get directly to \nyou, but it does show the stupidity of the elves.  Instead of \nlaunching their most powerfull attacks, they constistently stick with \ntheir basic attack most of the time, even at point blank range against \nyou.  I have been playing against it for a while, and I still have \ntrouble beating it with either my mega mage or mega archmage.\n\nAnyway I do not expect replies to this message.\n\n\n"}}
