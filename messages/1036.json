But what about general attitude? Is this guy really disagreeable, wary of the good guy group, reckless or what?\nAnd are you mentioning &quot;magicify&quot;ing his arrows to make them better as a cool idea you want me to incorporate?\nProps to you for giving a good character description. Rory could take a lesson from you. If I can&#39;t get anything I&#39;ll just have to set my creative powers to work.\n\n-Zjack\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free! \r\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143 \r\n\r\n\n\n"}}
