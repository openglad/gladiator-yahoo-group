I tried to attach the files to my original thread, however it got deleted by the group I&#39;m guessing.\nWhat a shame. I would give out a weblink to my webpage, however I&#39;ve been recently banned from @home for running a DNS server in my basement. Go figure.\nmy eccentrix website doesn&#39;t allow me to upload ZIP files for some stupid reason, so I&#39;m on the lookout for free webspace with no banner, CGI-BIN and 10+ megs of space.\nI&#39;m looking at digitalrice.com which gives me all that, however there&#39;s a four day wait before I can sign up. Unless you can give me a place besides your email to send it.\n\n-Trahern\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nGet free personalized email at http://www.iname.com\n\n"}}
