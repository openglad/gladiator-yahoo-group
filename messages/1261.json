Talk about the balance of power\n&gt; favoring an archmage.  \n\nyea but from a fantasy standpoint, this is fine.  I mean, in any story or \nwhatever, when you think of an archmage, you think of someone who has a lot \nmore power than anyone else.  So concievably this should be the case here \ntoo.  Of course from a gameplay standpoint maybe it&#39;s not so good.  I donno.\n\n&gt; Chain lightning - if implemented properly - would rock.  But chain\n&gt; lightning shouldn&#39;t be used against more than 20 opponents until it\n&gt; is revised unless you want your computer to freeze over.  I&#39;ve tried\n&gt; increasing memory allocation to gladiator, shutting down as many\n&gt; programs as possible, and slowing down/speeding up the game to improve\n&gt; the performance of chain lightning.  If someone knows of any way that\n&gt; improves the performance of chain lightning, EMAIL THE GROUP.\n\nwell, appart from getting some really kickass hardware. . .  \nI think I remember a discussion a while back about the chain lightning thing. \n Might have something to do with how it was coded; I think Tom told us how it \nwas done, but I don&#39;t really remember.   Whatever, I need to get back to my \nphysics. . \n\n-- \nEverything could easily have turned out different\n\n"}}
