They&#39;re not particularly fun to play, and they&#39;re all basically \nset on the first map, South of Talwood. I noticed that they&#39;re designed so \nonly a mage or archmage would have a fighting chance of winning...\n\nI&#39;d like to propose a new trainable stat: \n&quot;Not-running-around-like-a-chicken-with-its-head-cut-off&quot;. Even with a \nzillion armor, nearby explosions tend to send my characters prancing all \nover the screen, running here and there and subsequently getting scared by \nghosts. I mean, how shocked and bewildered is an archmage with several \nhundred intelligence going to be if a tower he was shooting at blows up?\n\nStill working on various little Gladiator projects... when they&#39;re done I&#39;ll \npost them to my Gladiator site. The Warcraft II stuff I&#39;ve been doing has \nbeen much quicker to see completion, so I&#39;d better create a page for that \ntoo. Anyone else out there do levels for Gladiator AND Warcraft? It&#39;s so \nmuch easier to create a storyline with Gladiator, but Warcraft has ships and \nsome decent magic...\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
