(IE: normal \narrow, but always insta-death)\n\nI think it sounds cool, but it might unbalance the game. Also might \nneed to change explanation.\n\nFor the Orcs:\n\nBerserk - An Orc with enough power can bring upon itself rage in \nwhich it may destroy anyting that stands in it&#39;s way. (Like Charge, \nbut kills everything it hits, including your own side so be careful)\n\nI&#39;d appreciate feedback, although neither of these is incredibly \nlikely to reach Openglad Enhanced or Gladiator: Beyond Freedom...\n\n\n\n"}}
