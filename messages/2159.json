The teleporters are there, well, to keep your\nhired team from doing anything stupid (anybody got a better idea of\nhow to preserve the look AND keep your hired team from doing the wrong\nthing).  I&#39;m a little concerned about the courtyard entrance to the\nmain area of the castle being a little crowded, though.\n\nI got the idea after watching a video in World History class about\ncastle construction in England.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
