How exactly would Reincarnate Character work? I see \n&gt; little difference between that and Ressurect.\n\nBig difference: resurrect brings your teammates back in the same \ncharacter class they were originally in and brings opponents back as \nghosts.  Reincarnate brings characters (both teammates and opponents) \nback from the dead in a random character class.\n\nSuppose an image from an opponent archmage was killed.  Normally, I \ncould only bring it back as either a skeleton or a ghost.  With \nreincarnate,  I could bring that image back as anything.\n\n\n"}}
