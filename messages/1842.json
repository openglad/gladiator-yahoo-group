I was playing in &quot;battle&quot; difficulty (forgot to change it to\nslaughter), and I didn&#39;t cheat. There are a few reasons I was able to beat\nthe game. One is that I had no computer allies to worry about, so just me\non my own was the entire team. Then comes the fact that once a thief gets\nto a high enough level, he can pretty much permenately stay cloaked, which\nbasically means that as long as you eliminate druids and don&#39;t pick fights\nwith ghosts, you&#39;re really not gonna be harmed at all by AI players. The\nthird reason is, of course, slime farming :-)\n\n- Yan\n\n\n"}}
