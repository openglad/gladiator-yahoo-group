In fact, I did take some \ninspiration from Diablo 2 (awesome game too).  Another name does need to be \ncome up with.  I also came up with another promotion idea, this one for the \narcher.  I&#39;d call it the Ranger, which I think sounds nicely, only I don&#39;t \nhave any ideas for specials.\n\n"}}
