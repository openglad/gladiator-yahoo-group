None of us has any reason to &quot;lie&quot; about\n&gt; our skills (or lack of such).  Been working the last couple days and\n&gt; probably a couple more.  Anyway, if anyone is dying to see what I can\n&gt; do, most of my C stuff is on my website (www.perfidious.net) with source\n&gt; code n stuff; uder the &quot;my brain children&quot; link I think.  Anyway if I\n&gt; have time sometime in the next week or so maybe I&#39;ll do this grid file\n&gt; extraction thing.  It sounds like a good/interesting warmup type\n&gt; project; as well as making me do some much needed review on C++ I&#39;m\n&gt; sure.\n&gt;\n&gt; Deathifier wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Oh, heh, so you want it to read and write the files in full :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Alrighty, thats not much harder, I just wanted to make it clear since\nthe\n&gt; &gt; mention of object grid sorta confused me, and it&#39;s better to not have\nmany\n&gt; &gt; ambiguities.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Heh, it sounds like this is an assessment... :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Deathifier\n&gt; &gt; *Goes back to studying for maths exam.*\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shouldn&#39;t be too hard to extract them, any particular format you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; want the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; text file in?  Perhaps one object per line, tab-delimited?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would want all the information [located in grid file] from &quot;3-byte\n&gt; &gt; &gt; header: &#39;FSS&#39;&quot; to &quot;m bytes == characters on this line&quot; in the text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; file.  Format the information however you choose; readibility of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; information and neatness count, though.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
