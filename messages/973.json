It&#39;s because of the attacks.\n\nSoldiers are just magic guzzlers.  A thief with the exact same mount \nof energy could do more damage than a soldier.  Boomerang attacks \naren&#39;t that good against tents. \n\nAt exp level 200+, a knife does as much damage as some of other \nattacks.  Of course, that&#39;s true for most characters: basic attacks \nbecome as lethal as advanced attacks at high experience levels, but \nthe advanced attacks don&#39;t become super-lethal.\n\n\n"}}
