I&#39;ve stopped playing the\n&gt;game...gotten old. Nonetheless, I&#39;d like to take it up again if something\n&gt;new came out (levels, another game, etc.)\n\nNope... I&#39;m trying to get a levels-compilation going, and right now I&#39;m just \nwaiting for other people&#39;s levels. Go ahead and send them to me--I can&#39;t \nvery well just use my own levels; that wouldn&#39;t be much of a compilation, \nnow would it? I don&#39;t want to heckle you guys about it, but you&#39;ve been \nasking for this for over a year.        -Tevildo.\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
