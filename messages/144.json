Let\nthis be an end to our disagreement. \n\nAbout Gladiator...\nI was wondering what you guys used to program it, I am learning the basics\nof C and C++ and would like to learn some more about graphical coding. Would\nit be possible to see some of your source code (heh heh...not likely, eh?)\nor at least maybe direct me to somewhere I could learn more...It seems that\nall the graphic resources available online are way too advanced or only for\nspecific compilers such as Microsoft Visual C++ which I don&#39;t have the\npleasure of owning.
