So I went there, and so this \nmailing list. I was just curious, did they move websites? Because \nthat website hasn&#39;t been updated in forever. And is Beyond Freedom \nstill coming out? I sent an e-mail to the addy the website gives \nabout 6 months ago asking, but no reply. Thanks for your time.\n\n                             -Wes\n\n\n"}}
