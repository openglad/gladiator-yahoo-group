I would like to be able to buy Golems and \nGiant Skeletons.  This might seem ridiculious, but how about a set of \ncharacter classes that can surive in water?  That seem limiting, but \ncurrently, only 2 current characters classes can go over water.\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Ricky Der&quot; &lt;TheLegendaryLight@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;    Hmmm, A new class?  How Bout a Mimic? those are cool, pluse we \nshould\n&gt; have other classes like bards or Enchanters hehehe\nhmm.  We already have mages so we do not need enchanters.  How a \ncharacter class that is a cross between a Cleric and a Mage?\n\nI would love to see the Archer be able to shoot a poison arrow.  It \nwould continiously take off 2-5 health points every second.  Also, a \nbarrage of exploding arrows would be a nice addition to the arsenal\nof \nan Archer.\n\n\n"}}
