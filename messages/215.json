I have played it for over 1\nhour \nand still unable to beat it at skirmish.  I left it with exactly 1 \nslime left.\n\nThe goal of the level is to build lots of experience for every team \nmember.  I have been playing it with 1 mage, 1 archmage, and 2 \nclerics.\n\nI spent over 150 million to create a team of one archer to beat the \nlevel.  He had experience level of 500 and everything else had a\nlevel \nof 1000 and he was unable to win (in fact, he kept dying).\n\nThe level is in a zipped file at \nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/scen350.zip .  You will need to skip \nover to level 350 to play it.\n\nIf anyone can tell me what would take to beat that level, let me know.\n\n\n"}}
