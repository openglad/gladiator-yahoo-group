As far as I know, there \nhas yet to be any game devolped even remotly similiar to Gladiatar, \nand just imagine all the things you could do with a publisher like \nBlizzard backing you. I mean, there would be B.net Gladiator, which \nwould be so cool. I can just see now like 16 people in a game, all \ncontrolling one character be it as a co-op through the campaign, a \nteam pvp, or a massive free for all. I mean, you&#39;d probably need to \nredo the grapchics from scartch, but any storyline you had you could \nstill keep, and if you&#39;d already had the music composed it may need \nto be touched up but would still work. Well, just thought I&#39;d ask :P \nBtw, anyone who is waiting for Warcraft 3 to drop, I just got it for \n42.45 from www.dirtcheapsoftware.com . I think someone else had it as \ncheap, but they had a lower merchant rating, but pricegrabber.com is \nplace to check (heh, all the other Gamespy users are going to be \nduhing me right about now.)\n\n\n"}}
