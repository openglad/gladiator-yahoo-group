Might you mean Tevildo&#39;s TevFifty?\nI realised that after I sent it, sorry :)\n\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Tevildo:\n&gt; Alrighty, since I know how valuable feedback is I might as well throw in\nmy\n&gt; 2 cents worth :) I went through the levels with a Cleric (Yes that is &#39;a&#39;,\n&gt; as in 1, I find any computer controlled characters run off and die...). I\ndo\n&gt; not know if it was a legit cleric, I remember long ago playing around with\n&gt; values to see what happened, and I hadn&#39;t played since then, but the\nnumbers\n&gt; for stats seemed just a little high :)\n&gt; I made it through, there were a few annoying levels, many of which\ninvolved\n&gt; the &quot;No you can&#39;t go through that teleporter, there is something on the\n&gt; other side&quot; problem, which isn&#39;t anything you can fix easily :( &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; No, the only way to fix that was to increase the hallway width to the\npoint\n&gt; where it won&#39;t fit on the map anymore.\nThe best fix would be in the game itself, where teleporters act like those\nin quake, and squish (kill) whatever is on the other side :)\n\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Lets see:\n&gt; The stairs levels, very well designed, but utterly confusing as to where\n&gt; they went, I ran around them for ages, and ages and ages, it was difficult\n&gt; to tell which way I was supposed to be going to go up or down to the next\n&gt; level/flight.  It was also difficult to navigate on foot, slightly wider\n&gt; pathways would help immensely (if possible).  I remember finally\nabondoning\n&gt; going up to the top, or whatever was supposed to be at the end, as going\n&gt; round in circles is not my idea of progress :)&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; That was supposed to be confusing. Endless staircases climbing into the\nsky?\n&gt; Weird. Confusing. Solution? Have your cleric summon a ghost.\nYeah I did that, it got over the single levels, but I still couldn&#39;t get to\nthe top of the &#39;chain&#39; (assuming there is one :), also I found that only a\nsmall number of monsters could actually be summoned as ghosts, if the pile\nof blood wasn&#39;t very close to the center of the hallway I couldn&#39;t summon\nanything from it.\n\n&gt; The problem\n&gt; with wider pathways is that there wouldn&#39;t be enough room  between\nflights,\n&gt; and the NPCs would stand slightly off-center on the teleporter, never\ncoming\n&gt; through but still blocking.\nWider as in a few pixels wider, it&#39;s almost wide enough, also makes hand to\nhand combat hard (but thats another game problem...).  It&#39;s quite ok as it\nis though :)\n\n&gt; &lt;&lt;The ocean without a boat scenario, I tried to play it but it only ever\n&gt; took 1 hit to kill me.  I&#39;m not sure if this is the way the level was\n&gt; designed (ie - super-powerful monsters) or it was something to do with the\n&gt; game and being over the ocean.  An exit from that level would also be\nnice,\n&gt; I couldn&#39;t see one on the minimap, and I thought it might be a good idea\nto\n&gt; include a link back to the dock you stepped off, we are swimming right?\nJust\n&gt; turn around and swim back :) &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, I originally planned to end my set with something unbeatable, but\nthen\n&gt; I decided that would be too depressing so I stuck it on the side. It\nreally\n&gt; is unbeatable, unless you&#39;re doing something very wrong. there is an exit\n&gt; but it&#39;s very well hidden ; ).\nAh, well I obviously didn&#39;t last long enough to find it then :)  I managed\nto kill one of the monsters, just not getting hit was difficult.\n\nCya,\nDeathifier (David Storey)\n\n\n\n"}}
