I thought I was helping the OpenGlad project by putting \nout those little problems.\n\nAnyways, I have contributed some and do plan on contributing more to \nOpenGlad.\n\nWhen I get a chance, I do plan on doing some work with the operations \nof the Smoother Program in the scenario creator.  I have already \nported out the entire Smoother Program into a Visual Basic program, \nand I started work on a Random Object Generator for Gladiator maps.  I \ngotta do some more work on that.  I was working integrating graphics \ninto my Random Object Generator for gladiator maps and improving the \nintelligence of placing objects a bit.\n\nThe slowest bit of upgrading the intelligence is working out exactly \nhow much space each object takes on the map so I can avoid placing \nsome objects on top of each other.\n\n\n\n"}}
