It would still have the basic teleport abilities.  This one\n&gt; could teleport teammates and as an alternate teleport enemies.  Also,\n&gt; this one could freeze time, and as an alternate slow down time for\n&gt; enemies.  It could create teleporters and as an alternate create\n&gt; black\n&gt;  holes.  The black holes would kill enemies and teammates alike when\n&gt; they entered it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I noticed a mage&#39;s magical bolts are more powerfull than a heartburst\n&gt; attack because a heartburst attack takes more energy to kill a\n&gt; character.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
