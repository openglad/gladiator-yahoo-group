The spaces \nbetween the rows was horrible to the point where the golems I placed \nin the middle were partly in trees.\n\nYea, I&#39;m asking for input about the space between the rows being \nsufficient if it&#39;s not I can readjust it easily.  I know about the \nsmoother issues with the grass, but that is a sign of something: this \nscenario was recreated entirely by a program. :-)  So I can easily add \nmore spaces between each row just by adjusting some code.  I know I \nneed to add spaces to travel between the rows, but I&#39;ll have to figure \nout how to do that efficiently.\n\nOnce I&#39;m settled with that map being correct, I&#39;ll put the characters \nin the appropriate places.\n\n\n"}}
