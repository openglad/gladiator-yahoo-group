So use them to block. And \nthe walls with battlements, the slots at the top, allow things to be fired \nthrough them. The one problem with that is that Scen.exe only gives you the \ncrenellated walls which run horizontally across the screen. The vertical \nones do exist (I&#39;ve used &#39;em a lot), but you have to grab them off of a \npre-existing level and then load your level. I think you can find them at \nthe far left of Jakarta&#39;s Woods... For stuff like this, I used Editor.exe to \nmake a palette map which contains every tile. Each tile has a corresponding \nnumber in Editor, so you just click on 1, set down a tile, click 2, set down \na tile, etc. The problem is that if you go too far, the map won&#39;t load, and \nI forget exactly how many tile types there are. You can find out for \nyourself, of course, using trial and error. Definitely more than a hundred.  \n          -T.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
