And your skeletons \nhave massive amounts of health as you go up in levels. I once had \nalmost all my skeletons have 21,000+ health in a level. And I was \nonly level 21. This is not right. I dont know but it seems like \nclerics are by far the most powerful of the regular classes. \n\n(All characters should be able to bury corpse, so that it goes away.)\n\nArchmage: The only hybird class so far, and the most powerful \ncharacter. Summon fire elemental is over powered, but compared to \nchain lightning is nothing. Chain lightning destroys whole levels of \nguys in seconds. On my old computer it would lags soo bad when I shot \nit that all I would do was shoot it and come back 2-3 minutes later \nto find the whole level dead. With enough mana you can fire multiply \nchain lightnings while telporting and destroy anything. Archmages \nshould be more balanced.\n\n\n"}}
