The\nsource file is &quot;pixedit.c&quot; and it can be found at: \nhttp://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/snowstorm/openglad-enhanced/util/\nYou should be able to compile it with Borland providing that you\ninclude the SDL libraries also. \n\nIf you are interesting in modifying a lot of graphics, you should\ncheck out Openglad-Enhanced. I converted Openglad-e to use targa\ngraphics so virtually any graphics editor can be used to work on the\nOpenglad-e graphics. You can find all the targified graphics here:\nhttp://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/snowstorm/openglad-enhanced/pix/.\nHowever, you would need to use Openglad-e which we havn&#39;t officially\nreleased yet. You can download the cvs version though. It is sort of\nbuggy since we are currently working on it; however, it has full\nsupport for targa graphics, and ogg vorbis sound files. Yan has been\nworking on implementing Lua scripting support. I think about half the\nspecials are currently using Lua scripts. All the characters are\ndefined in Lua scripts too which allows you to easily tweak them.\nAgain, Openglad-e is still being developed and the cvs version isn&#39;t\nfully playable without crashing.\n\nYan and I mainly use GNU software on Linux to edit and compile\nopenglad. I personally use vim for all my coding. We use standard GNU\nmake, autoconf, and gcc to compile openglad. Borland should be able to\ncompile Openglad/-e as long as you have all the proper libraries\n(SDL,SDL_image,SDL_mixer and the Lua libs for Openglad-e). \n\nSean\nhttp://snowstorm.sourceforge.net\n\n\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, Jonathan Maltezo &lt;jonmaltezo@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Hey, do you guys want me to create a gladiators website/forums? I\ncan get free webspace since I am an application reviewer at\nillusionfxnet.com. Also, does anyone know how to edit .pix files? I\ncan&#39;t seem to find any programs that do.\n&gt; \n&gt; What programs do you guys use to edit/compile openglad? I have no\nclue on what to do when compiling, so yeah. (Using Borland)\n&gt; \n&gt; Meh, I was hoping that open-glad would use bmp files so I could try\nadding new classes. Maybe someone can add multiplayer to it, I dunno.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________________________\n&gt; Do You Yahoo!?\n&gt; Tired of spam?  Yahoo!
