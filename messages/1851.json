I mean, \n they&#39;re the ones who are _really_ associated with fighting...\n\nThanks.  I&#39;m going to try to map out the entire set ahead of time.\n\nAs I&#39;ve said before, I believe soldiers are mana guzzlers, but it may \njust be the stats I have.  I&#39;ll set up a test scenario to compare the \nbarbarian and soldier in terms of damage per mana usage.\n\n* * \n\nI went through all my hedge scenarios, the Port City, almost all of \none path and I still run into the damn problem with my characters \nbeing killed in &quot;Archer Encampment&quot;.  Worse yet, it&#39;s the same one who \ngets dying: the Archer.  I&#39;ve spent a couple of fortunes improving the \narmor level, but to no result.\n\n[I may redo Archer Encampment some more: put extra doors in place to \nslow down the rate of facing opponent teams and maybe widen some of \nthose passages again so that I can use exploding bolt attack without \nhurting myself.]\n\nWhat good is a super-strong character who can&#39;t take the hits?  It&#39;s \nutterly stupid that the opponent archers are strong enough to wipe \neach other out fairly easily.  (Personally, I like to keep armor \nlevels pretty close to strength levels.  Also, high constitution \nlevels make you more vulnerable to faerie attacks so forget \nself-healing.  Clerics aren&#39;t much good if you can be taken out in 1-2 \nhits.)\n\nThe problem isn&#39;t my attacks aren&#39;t strong enough, but I run out of \nmana fairly quickly killing a lot of them in an area without killing \nall of them.  I&#39;m concerned about raising the intelligence too high \nwill in the long run be harmfull if the characters ever reach certain \nexperience levels.\n\n[All the same, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if a 10 member team could, in \nfact, go through my own scenarios without running into constant \nproblems.  If, in addition to the built-in scenarios, I had about 100 \nmore scenarios to set-up my team, completing the tevfifty afterwards \nwould get me a team strong enough to complete my own scenarios. ]\n\nIt&#39;s also ridiculous that my cleric can raise a skeleton or a ghost \nwith more health and mana than the cleric has.\n\nIt&#39;s annoying that my level 30+ druid can summon faeries that are only \nlevel 1.  Of course, the druid can&#39;t run out of mana growing trees \nbecause of the time delay between growing trees.\n\n\n"}}
