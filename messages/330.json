I know what the scenario has to \nbe to fit into the plans, but I am just not happy with it.  Yes, it is \nthe 1st one where the player actually gets help.  I will test it again \nwith the new changes I have made to see if I am finally happy with it. \n If I finally become happy with it, I will be working on some more new \nones.\n\nSide notes:  interestingly enough, I am getting around to giving the \nplayer some help (NPCs) in some scenarios.\n\nOne thing I have noticed about skeletons: when they shoot out their \nbones, they never use up any magic power, even at experience level 1.\n\nFaeries vs Skeletons for which is easiest:  skeletons are a joke if \nyou have an experienced cleric to take care of them.\n\nI know there is a most powerfull character in the game (archmage), so \nit seems to me that logically there must be a weakest character.  Yes, \nthe outcome of this debate will effect a future scenario I am going to \nbuild for the sole purpose of testing mega (experience level 100 and \nhigher) hired characters.  That scenario will be the absolute easiest \nscenario ever (without NPCS) and filled up lots and lots of gold.\n\nTevildo, take your time.\n\n\n"}}
