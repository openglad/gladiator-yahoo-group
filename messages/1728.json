One a time I went through a level \nwithout a cleric and couldn&#39;t win without massive casualties.  I hired \na cleric and casualities disappeared.\n\nHeck, you could place 2 clerics side by side in a battle and they \ncould keep healing themselves without causing any damage while racking \nup lots of experience points.\n\n\n"}}
