Might you mean Tevildo&#39;s TevFifty?\n\n&lt;&lt;Tevildo:\nAlrighty, since I know how valuable feedback is I might as well throw in my \n2 cents worth :) I went through the levels with a Cleric (Yes that is &#39;a&#39;, \nas in 1, I find any computer controlled characters run off and die...). I do \nnot know if it was a legit cleric, I remember long ago playing around with \nvalues to see what happened, and I hadn&#39;t played since then, but the numbers \nfor stats seemed just a little high :)\nI made it through, there were a few annoying levels, many of which involved \nthe &quot;No you can&#39;t go through that teleporter, there is something on the \nother side&quot; problem, which isn&#39;t anything you can fix easily :( &gt;&gt;\n\nNo, the only way to fix that was to increase the hallway width to the point \nwhere it won�t fit on the map anymore.\n\n&lt;&lt;Lets see:\nThe stairs levels, very well designed, but utterly confusing as to where\nthey went, I ran around them for ages, and ages and ages, it was difficult \nto tell which way I was supposed to be going to go up or down to the next \nlevel/flight.  It was also difficult to navigate on foot, slightly wider \npathways would help immensely (if possible).  I remember finally abondoning \ngoing up to the top, or whatever was supposed to be at the end, as going \nround in circles is not my idea of progress :)&gt;&gt;\n\nThat was supposed to be confusing. Endless staircases climbing into the sky? \nWeird. Confusing. Solution? Have your cleric summon a ghost. The problem \nwith wider pathways is that there wouldn�t be enough room  between flights, \nand the NPCs would stand slightly off-center on the teleporter, never coming \nthrough but still blocking.\n\n&lt;&lt;The ocean without a boat scenario, I tried to play it but it only ever \ntook 1 hit to kill me.  I&#39;m not sure if this is the way the level was \ndesigned (ie - super-powerful monsters) or it was something to do with the \ngame and being over the ocean.  An exit from that level would also be nice, \nI couldn&#39;t see one on the minimap, and I thought it might be a good idea to \ninclude a link back to the dock you stepped off, we are swimming right? Just \nturn around and swim back :) &gt;&gt;\n\nWell, I originally planned to end my set with something unbeatable, but then \nI decided that would be too depressing so I stuck it on the side. It really \nis unbeatable, unless you�re doing something very wrong� there is an exit \nbut it�s very well hidden ; ).\n\n&lt;&lt;Aside from that, I think the rest were good, they had a reasonably linear \nplot and I especially like the garden of golden apples, I ran around it \nchecking out what I missed on the way through :)  Very nice idea.  There \narn&#39;t any design bugs I can remember, and many scenarios provided a \nchallenge - such as those where the NPC can&#39;t die, and said NPC starts \nsurrounded by not-so-happy nasties.  Clerics and mass-killing don&#39;t go well \ntogether :)  The door guard at one of the castles (knox?) was good too, an \ninvisible barrier that fights back, it goes some way towards realism (where \nyou&#39;d siege the door while taking damage), about as far as you probably can \nin the game.&gt;&gt;\n\nI had to include the Garden of the Hesperides because otherwise nobody would \never get to the �hidden � levels. Even I might not be able to find them all� \nI like variety, and the save-the-NPC levels provided a nice break from \nblow-everything-up levels. As for Nox (little play on words� �Knox� for Fort \nKnox, and �Nox� meaning night, as it&#39;s an invisible tower)at the Castle of \nThree Peaks... in reality, you need roughly seven times your enemy�s forces \nto overwhelm a fortified location. That�s a lot of dead bodies, and I didn�t \nknow how else to show that in Gladiator.\n\n&lt;&lt;Overall I think they are excellent, it&#39;s good to see some levels roaming \naround, especially those that have very few problems.&gt;&gt;\n\nWhy thank you.\n\n&lt;&lt;Cya,\nDeathifier (David Storey)\n- Beware, midnight brings about incoherant mumbling as sure as the sun\nbrings warmth to the earth.&gt;&gt;\n\n    -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n        (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html)\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
