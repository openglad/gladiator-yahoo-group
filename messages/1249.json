The other thing I would like to bring up is a\nGiant Skeleton being able to form a tornado and use the tornado to hit\nopponents.\n\nFire Elementals - I still like the idea of a suicide attack for fire\nelementals, but only available for fire elementals that are not\nsummoned and are at least experience level 12.  I would also love a\ngiant fireball attack.\n\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nChat with friends online, try MSN Messenger: http://messenger.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
