Frankly, I \ndon&#39;t see a reason to touch up any more of scenarios for now.\n\nI am going to start working on compiling answers for the Scenario \nTrivia Contest.\n\nI am NOT posting the code for how I moved, deleted, and added objects \nunless there is some demand for it because frankly, I&#39;ve shown how to \ndo everything before.  The only difference is I have integrated \neverything.\n\n\n"}}
