I bought the full version for $10 from a store, but didn&#39;t register. \nWould registering have given me access to more scenarios or something like \nthat? If it does, how can I get those scenarios now?\n\n2. Is the ultimate goal of the game to beat Jakara (or whatever his name \nis)? Something that really bothers me about this game is it never says &quot;The \nend&quot; or &quot;Congratulations, you win!&quot; or anything... there just aren&#39;t any \nmore opponents on the levels anymore.\n\n3. Why are there golems and giant skeletons programmed in the game if they \nnever show up in any ordinary scenarios?\n\nI suppose that if the answer to 1. is &quot;yes, registering would have gotten \nyou more scenarios&quot; then 2. and 3. kind of answer themselves... but these \nare all things I&#39;ve been wondering for a while. Now, I&#39;m not signed up for \nYahooGroups and I don&#39;t really know much about how they work, so I don&#39;t \neven know if this message will reach somebody, or if I&#39;ll even be able to \nread the answer if it does. So... if somebody gets this message, can you \nplease just email me back at yourfaceisaface@...? Thanks very much.\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nDon&#39;t just Search. Find! http://search.sympatico.msn.ca/default.aspx The new \nMSN Search!
