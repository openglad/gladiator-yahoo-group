Let&#39;s here those new ideas.\n\nI would bring back the idea of a couple of promoted characters:\n\n1)practical mage - same basic attack A mage,\nwith teleport and leave teleport marker as 1st attack\nwith stop time and slow down time as 2nd attack\nteleport teammates and teleport opponents as 3rd attack\ncreate teleporter and create blackhole (anything steps inside is \nkilled) as 4th attack.\n\nThe blackhole would be one of the most powerfull attacks.\n\n2)High priest, same basic type as cleric,\n1st attack = heal/mystic mace\n2nd attack = wide area heal/greater heal (heal beyond 100% health)\n3rd attack = summon curse/undo curse (random selection of which curse \nis applied from many choices)\n4th attack = resurrect character / reincarinate character\n\n\n"}}
