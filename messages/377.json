Will the same scenario editor for Gladiator\n&gt;work for G:BF?  If so, what scenario numbers will be open?  Can anyone\n&gt;of us registered users create some scenarios that will be pre-included\n&gt;  in the G:BF?  If so, I might be willing to work on some &#39;normal&#39;\n&gt;scenarios for the future game.\n\nG:BF uses a slightly different file system than Glad 3.x; however, there&#39;s \nalso an included, modified version of the scenario editor that takes all \nthat into account .. it should be in the zip file, along with lots of other \ncrud in that particular zip that I didn&#39;t get a chance to filter out tonight.\n\nRight now, no numbers are hard-set for the scenario levels; we&#39;ve been \nplaying around in the 100-120 region, just &quot;because,&quot; .. rather than for \nany reason .. eventually we&#39;ll work everything back to a coherent set, but \nanything you want to work with in terms of numbers is fine (it&#39;s always \neasy to shift a set of levels later if need be).\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
