And the bombs did some serious damage to the walls. Funny that&#39;s not how it&#39;s supposed to happen.\n\nWhy are we still stuck with a game that was last released in 1998? Time for some new versions. I couldn&#39;t even download Glad5, that .zip link has been broken forever.\nWhy is the game called Gladiator at all? Don&#39;t most gladiators carry a sword? Oh yeah that&#39;s right, those guys with the white helmets have swords. But I just kick their ass with fire elementals and chain lightning.\nCome on guys you really have chars that are lvl 100 + ?\nIs there any point to hiring any class except an archer or mage? If the game is really that easy for you why don&#39;t you hire a team with some druids or thieves or orcs?\n\nFrom what I can tell (playing two player and or three player mode on slaughter with my brothers)\nSoldier: sword throw is ok, real power is in charge.\ncleric: heals the grunts, makes a base to fight off the pesky baddies.\nmage/archer: hides in base and shoots the enemies.\n\nThose are my three guys for the game. I can&#39;t cram a 4th guy at the keyboard, it locks up. :( And I&#39;d need a 60 inch screen to get a good view with the split screen action. Is there any other point to the characters out there? I mean i see these graphics of guys on my screen that aren&#39;t on my team, but who cares?\n\n(feel free to tell me how incorrect my judgement is cause it might be interesting to use these guys)\nThief: bombs = useless; cloak = semi-useless; taunt = ???; gas cloud = unpredictable.\nElf: wow. rocks. Enough said. and damn slow too.\nOrc: nice howl there pal. Try standing up to Dirk and his elves on lvl 1.\nOrc Capn: nice thief-dagger. You do anything else besides have that nice shoulder armor?\nBarbarian: interesting hammer. Where the boulders coming from? seems like a new soldier without the charge (aka the best move ever)\nSkeleton: like a soldier, but faster. wheres the charge?\nGhost: way to make the bad guys run, bud.\nPixie: (see druid) good for freezing really tough badguys maybe.\nDruid: lightning. nice range... and trees make good backbone for a base, but where&#39;s the heal? faeries are nice too, but pretty big (small) pushovers.\nSlime: always fun, but you usually get rocked before you can split enough times to fight back. and if your team isn&#39;t all slime, it will be soon when your other guys can&#39;t get on the field.\nFire Elemental: well he LOOKS tough. Starburst is nice... I guess... Kind of lame game play if you ask me.\n\nAm I on the mark with this assessment? [Please don&#39;t kill me Tom I still think you guys rOOl] If the game is no longer challenging would it be sneaky to get more players and fight over who gets the $ upgrades? maybe play with a bigger team and share the $? Maybe play with characters that don&#39;t use teleport?\n\n\nYou guys seemed relaxed and easy going, so I think I can assume a warmer welcome than I got in the ladies change-room. Yeah sure they did a lot of screaming but I figure that&#39;s the worst that you guys could do too. It would probably be in caps, not high pitched shreaks. And those high heels can really hurt your eyeballs, you know?\nJust some thoughts.\n-Trahern\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nGet free personalized email at http://www.iname.com\n\n"}}
