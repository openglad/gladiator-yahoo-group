Once I\n&gt; deleted a line I shouldn&#39;t have and couldn&#39;t save the file with the\n&gt; built-in scenario editor.  Another time I copied and pasted into a\n&gt; file and ended up with the same line repeated twice.  The built-in\n&gt; scenario editor didn&#39;t like that either.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
