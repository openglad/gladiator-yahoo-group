I can&#39;t have got extra large to be successfull yet.  Those numbers represent how big in pixels each map tile is represented by a box.  Tiny works well for just the maps, but I when I put objects on the map, . . . tiny and small aren&#39;t exactly my preferred options.\n-- \n___________________________________________________________\nSign-up for Ads Free at Mail.com\nhttp://promo.mail.com/adsfreejump.htm\n\n\n"}}
