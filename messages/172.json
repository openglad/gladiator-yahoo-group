Just drop it.\n\n&gt;I was working on a set a while back, but... frankly, it&#39;s too difficult to\n&gt;use the editor effectively.. I mean, I&#39;d be fine if it were text-based or\n&gt;if it were a windows executable or if it had instructions or if it didn&#39;t\n&gt;crash all the time (well, on my one system, at any rate)...\n\nIf you just send me what you have, I can finish. I find the Scen.exe to be \nvery usable... and there ARE instructions. Or are you talking about \nEditor.exe? Now that one is a bit tricky, but there&#39;s no need to use it for \nmaking a whole level. Wait... what ARE you talking about?\n\n\n&gt;DAYOFDRA.MOD is probably a MODULE music file. Go to http://www.modplug.com\n&gt;and grab the modplug player. Open the dayofdra.mod in the player, and you\n&gt;should start hearing music (if it IS a mod file)\n\nDAYOFDRA.MOD was a file LISTED in levels.001, but I&#39;ve been unable to unpack \nit... it&#39;s apparently just some of the extraneous stuff that found its way \nthere by accident, like the level 99 that gave all those people conniptions.\n\nC&#39;mon, folks, everyone was foaming at the mouths for a big compilation... \nlet&#39;s see some files!\n                  -Tevildo.\n______________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free Email at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n\n"}}
