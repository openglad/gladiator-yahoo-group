So keep all this in mind when making a scenario.  All\n&gt; my scenarios are bugged and i&#39;m working to fix them now.\n&gt; \n&gt;                                                                 The Legendary Light\n&gt; \n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Daniel Paul Hightower [mailto:dph_of_rules@...]\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 16, 2001 9:23 AM\n&gt; To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [gladiator] What makes a good scenario\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, time to attempt to jump start the list again.\n&gt; \n&gt; What makes a good/bad scenario?  I have my own ideas, but I will wait\n&gt; for responses to post my ideas.  Please site examples, but include\n&gt; scenario # and where the scenario is located if it is not part of the\n&gt; built-in scenarios.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, I am going somewhere with this topic.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
