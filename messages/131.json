I used to have it but since\n&gt;I had to format my hard drive, I lost it and was unable to get it back\n&gt;because the link on the site doesn&#39;t seem to work.  If you do, speak up\n&gt;and maybe you can send it over to me, I could mirror it on my FTP for the\n&gt;FSGames site (I run off a cable modem).  Also, if you&#39;ve got it and don&#39;t\n&gt;want to spend the time looking me up, upload it to a xoom account or\n&gt;something and post the address to this list.  Someone has *got* to have\n&gt;it.  Anyone? :)  (ICQ#: 18074806)\n&gt;\n&gt;Thanks guys, enjoy your weekend.\n&gt;      -Chris\n\nHi, Chris,\n\nIf you&#39;ve got a cable modem also, I can probably FTP it to you directly... \nthe link has, I know, been broken on the FSGames site for .. well, for \nquite a while, it appears!
