[Members \n of the tournament group can participate in this, but need to keep \ntournament group secrets SECRET.]\n\nAlso, considering the tournament is only 20 scenarios long, what type \nof teams are you considering?  Remember: every team has to have at \nleast 4 members.\n\nThe team I am considering is 2 clerics and 1 fire elemental.  I \nhaven&#39;t quite figured out who my 4th team member will be, but it \nwouldn&#39;t be a thief, a mage, a skeleton, or a ghost.\n\n\n"}}
