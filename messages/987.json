It&#39;s a lot \ndifferent from the last encouncter (#122) with druids (that was almost \nnightmarish).  I&#39;m actually trying to achieve a really high score on \nthat scenario.  So far, I haven&#39;t quite cracked 5 million (or is it \n5 hundred thousand?) on that scenario (it&#39;s not that loaded with \ngold).  It&#39;s scenario #145 in my set and I&#39;ve been playing it at \nslaughter.  The druids keep summoning faeries, even when there are \nalready 250 opponents.  It wouldn&#39;t half as difficult if the spells of \nprotection would disappear when opponent is destroyed or bombs/poison \nclouds destroyed those spells of protection.\n\n\n"}}
