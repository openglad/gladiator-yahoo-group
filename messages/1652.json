Hypothetically, you could keep time frozen until you \nwipe out the entire enemy force, as long as you have sufficient mana. \n It gets aggrevating if a friendly mage keeps freezing time when the \nrest of your team is out of mana.\n\nHeartburst is a very effective attack against 1-5 people.  If it \neffects more people, all you are doing is causing is chaos among enemy \nranks.  Side note: Using heartburst attack against slime has caused \nthe slime to grow, making heartburst not an effective attack against \nstrong slime.\n\nBarbarians really do need more attacks.\n\n\n"}}
