If there WERE some way of\nadding them to your team, the hybrid possibilities are\nendless. Imagine this: a soldier/tower combo, where\nthe tower appears in one of the &quot;Team Member&quot; boxes at\nthe start of the stage. The soldier (or other\ncharacter class, it doesn&#39;t matter) can foray out of\nthe tower and seek out the enemy, but if hard pressed\ncould retreat back into the tower for defense. While\nthe soldier is out, the tower has little or no attack\npower; while he&#39;s in it, the tower has high defense\nand special attacks (I&#39;m still in favour of a &quot;boiling\noil&quot; special that would harm all enemies adjacent to\nthe tower).\n\nOr how about a golem mage? That would be excellent.\n\nHas anyone done any work on a new tile set for the\ngiant skeleton? Does the program need a patch if the\nnew tile set is to have forward-facing and\nbackward-facing tiles that actually work?\n     -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
