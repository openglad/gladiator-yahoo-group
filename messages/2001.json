I think const might affect weapons damage.\n\nI do know that dex, strength, and intelligence (of course level does too) effects mana.\n\nI also know it&#39;s possible to have negative initial values for either mana or health that respectively make a character unable to attack or \ninstanteously die upon receiving any attack.\n\nI also know that summoned fire elementals, skeletons, and ghosts can have negative health and mana values without having any \neffect on them.\n\nLiterally, if I knew where the formulas for determing things are, I would stop to work out guides for reasonable limits on certain stats so \nthat you wouldn&#39;t accidently get negative values for either health or mana.\n\nRight now, my slime has a negative mana value. :( Since I have maxed out most of the other stats, my only choice is to increase its \nexperience level. \n\nDoes anyone think a team with virtually all of its members at experience level 444 can beat a certain ocean going scenario in the \ntevfifty?\n\n* * *\n\nI also know that OpenGlad with crash if you try to use the cheat code to change character type.\n\n\n"}}
