I\n&gt; recently obtained a copy of the Warcraft II Battlechest (full basic\nversion\n&gt; w/online matchup and expansion levels) and found that .PUDs are\n&gt; player-designed Warcraft levels, and those ones on the disk were all based\n&gt; on The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien. Naturally, I\n&gt; tried them out, and some of them kicked ass and some of them sucked. They\n&gt; got me thinking: the three games I&#39;m involved in now are Warcraft,\n&gt; Gladiator, and The Two Towers (a Tolkien-based Multi-User Dimension,\n&gt; http://angband.com/towers), and crossovers between the three would truly\n&gt; rock. Why not have Warcraft levels based on the stock Gladiator scenarios,\n&gt; or vice versa, or Tolkien-based scenarios with corresponding levels? I\nthrew\n&gt; some Greek mythology into the TevFifty, but I&#39;m thinking here of complete\n&gt; immersion in the story. Gladiator has several advantages in this\ndepartment:\n&gt; you can include the story blurb, which can be very cool; you can name\n&gt; characters; you can see who the enemy is and go kill him, rather than\nhaving\n&gt; to sit there whacking farms and such. With Warcraft, you have better\n&gt; graphics and the ability to wage war at sea and in the sky, but you can\nonly\n&gt; use the preprogrammed character names, and if you want a storyline you\nhave\n&gt; to put it in a separate text file. The magic and the maps are about equal.\n&gt; Anyone have any ideas in this vein? Over the semester break I should have\n&gt; enough time to actually execute some of this stuff in the Tevildo style,\nand\n&gt; also do that fanfic stuff I was talking about earlier with attached\n&gt; scenarios. I hope there are other people out there doing their own thing,\n&gt; and it&#39;s not just DPH and I creating. Ricky Derr, got any levels for us?\n&gt; Shayd? Anyone? Oh, man... how cool would it be to just insert the code for\n&gt; dragons and death knights into Gladiator... (salivating) That&#39;s all for\nnow.\n&gt; Good luck and regards,\n&gt;    -Tevildo.\n&gt;    http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Oh, did anyone get any use out of the altered rock graphics file I posted\nto\n&gt; the Egroups site? That was just an experiment... I could alter basically\nany\n&gt; weapon or character .PIX. Just say the word.\n&gt;\n____________________________________________________________________________\n_________\n&gt; Get more from the Web.
