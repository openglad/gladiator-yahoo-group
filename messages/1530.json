For example, say you start with a blank map of\nall dirt, or all grass, etc.  Then you design pieces like:\n    * forest of 12x6 (can be circular, square, or blob-ular) ...\n    * small house: 6x6 square, with tile inside, and opening facing\n[west/east/north/south/etc.]\n    * small lake\n    * large lake/ocean\n    * big house -- maybe &quot;L&quot; shaped or something.\n \nThis is basically how levels for the Diablo series are constructed.  Once\nyou have those, you can start with the backgrounds:\n    a) add from 1-5 &quot;lake&quot; objects\n    b) add from 1-5 &quot;forest&quot; objects\n \n... then you move to the foreground:\n    c) add 1-2 &quot;small house&quot; objects\n    d) add 1 &quot;big house&quot; object\n \n... etc.  Obviously, the more work you put in to making sure you don&#39;t get\nweird cases (a house in the middle of a lake, etc.), the better, but even a\nvery simple implementation can generate quite reasonable maps.\n \nAlso, there&#39;s a function in the scenario editor right now called the\n&quot;smoother&quot; (Zardus can probably point anyone who&#39;s interested to the right\nplace).  It takes care of things like randoming grass (so that it&#39;s not all\none tile), and making walls/trees/water/etc. form into the right tiles based\non where they are in relation to other pieces.  Using that code (or similar\ncode), you can just draw &quot;generic wall&quot; in a pattern, then have the smoother\nturn it into the correct wall pieces.\n \nAnyway, just some thoughts!\n \n--Tom\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"}}
