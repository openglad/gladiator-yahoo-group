That would make the game more realistic.  \nEssentially, it makes the medium size slime a shell around the small \nslime and makes the large size slime a shell around the medium size \nslime.\n\nAfter an exp level 100 fire elemental should be able to completely \nwipe-out a exp level 1 large slime with 1 blow and not leave any small \n or medium slime behind.\n\n\n"}}
