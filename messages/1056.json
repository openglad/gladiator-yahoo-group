It still wasn&#39;t through.  It took about 5 \n&gt; minutes for the program to process scenario 131 of my set and it has \n&gt; only 412 objects.  I am going to have to speed up the code, or put a \n&gt; warning out there.\n&gt; \n&gt; let me see 400 * 20 = 8000, and 5 * 20 = 100.  Hmm.  It might take \n&gt; around 100 minutes to put that scenario in text.  That&#39;s almost 2 \n&gt; hours and unacceptable.  I definitely am going to try to speed up \nthat \n&gt; code somehow.\n\nI waited almost 3 hours and it didn&#39;t finish displaying the \ninformation in the text.\n\nWhile trying to speed the program up, I found an error in the \nMicrosoft&#39;s programming: a function that is supposed to determine the \nlength of a file gives incorrect values or I could get the whole \nprocess done within 2 minutes on my PC because it takes less than 1 \nminute to put all the information in a file.\n\n\n"}}
