Thanks for the info, dph.\n&gt;\n&gt;And a big thanks to Tom, for providing the documentation.\n\nHi, guys,\n\nSorry that I&#39;ve been absent from the list recently -- in addition to work, \nI was in a car accident (totalled the car, but I walked away without a \nscratch), and it&#39;s meant I&#39;ve had to spend lots of time dealing with \nnon-Glad areas.  So thanks to dph, George, and all the rest for all the \nwork you&#39;re doing!\n\nMeanwhile, I thought I&#39;d answer a few of these notes (although I haven&#39;t \nread all the recent postings, so I may be out-of-date again).\n\n&gt;I&#39;m using scen300.fss as my template for analysis, since it&#39;s v8 already.\n&gt;\n&gt;Watch out for big-endian/little-endian problems if you&#39;re used to one or \n&gt;the other.. it took me quite a while to figure out why nothing matched up \n&gt;quite the way I thought it would. ^^;\n\nDefinitely :) We never considered porting to another system back then, so \nwe didn&#39;t bother making note of that...\n\n&gt; &gt;    // 8-byte string = grid name to load\n&gt;This apparently has something to do with the internal name of the file;\n&gt;&quot;SCEN0000&quot;, &quot;SCEN0030&quot;, etc..\n&gt;\n&gt;It doesn&#39;t seem to be *that* important, and could probably default to the \n&gt;filename (assuming it&#39;s 8.3)\n\nBasically, that&#39;s so that (technically) multiple scenario files can all use \nthe same background grid file.  For example, scen1.fss, scen2.fss, and \nscen3.fss could all use a background grid file called &quot;forest99&quot; if you \nwanted them to.\n\nIt&#39;s not a feature we ended up making much use of, though.\n\n&gt; &gt;    // 30-byte scenario title (ver 6+)\n&gt;\n&gt;Standard C String -- null terminated, then padded with garbage to get to \n&gt;the 30th byte.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    // 1-byte char = scenario type, default is 0\n&gt;\n&gt;I guess non-0 is for deathmatch. I&#39;m not gonna bother looking (mainly \n&gt;&#39;cause I dunno where the DM levels are stored. ;))\n&gt;\n&gt;Actually, when I converted scen1.fss to v8, it came up with a &#39;1&#39; rather \n&gt;than a &#39;0&#39;. Odd.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    // 2-bytes par-value, v.8+\n&gt;\n&gt;How fast you&#39;re supposed to complete the level, in hex, it seems. \n&gt;Unsigned, too.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    // 2-bytes (short) = total objects to follow\n&gt;\n&gt;unsigned, or signed?

How large are &#39;average&#39; maps? Is this a \n&gt;pixel-by-pixel thing? Or is it a block-by-block thing?\n\nPIX files are *very* simple: pretty much just a width value, a height \nvalue, and then width*height bytes of data to follow.\n\n&gt; &gt;           // 1-byte TEAM\n&gt;\n&gt;0x00 is red?\n&gt;0x01 is blue?\n&gt;0x02 is yellow?\n&gt;0x03 is green?\n&gt;0x04 is purple?\n&gt;\n&gt;... those are just guesses.
