Also, MS Visual C++ is generally reguarded as one of\nthe\n&gt;  best IDE&#39;s out there; if you&#39;ve got that you may want to give it another\ntry.\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried to understand a simple &quot;Hello World&quot; program written in that\nlanguage and had difficulty.  Maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s truly object\n&gt; oriented and I haven&#39;t had a truely object oriented programming class.  It\nmight be easier after I&#39;ve had studied true object oriented\n&gt; programming.\n\nTraditional 4 or 5 line hello world programs work fine in it, you just have\nto create a console application project.\nIt can compile C and C++ quite happily, nothing restricts you to a &#39;pure OO&#39;\nstyle :)\n\nThe key thing is the console app. project - make sure you create one of\nthose and you&#39;re set.\nGladiator should compile quite happily in it too :)\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
