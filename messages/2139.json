Keeping them alive isn&#39;t a problem (unless\nI&#39;m too slow), I&#39;ve made one of the enemy groups very strong.  Too\nstrong for you to beat.  This was on purpose; the stronger force is\ntrying to subdue a slave uprising, and you&#39;re caught in the middle.  I\nwanted to be able to beat the level without having to defeat the enemy\n(which is too powerful for you.. for now).  The thing is.. when I set\nthe &quot;Can Always Exit&quot; option to Yes, it won&#39;t let me leave until every\nenemy is destroyed, precisely what I *don&#39;t* want to have to do!  I\nknow it&#39;s possible because Nylwin City doesn&#39;t require you to kill\neveryone to proceed to the next level.  I could just make the enemy\nless powerful, but that would ruin my current story plot!  What am I\ndoing wrong?\n\n\n"}}
