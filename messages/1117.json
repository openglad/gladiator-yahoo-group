For \nexample: There is a war between old, pagan barbarians and a cleric-\nled proselytizing army.  Pick one to side with, fight say three \nlevels.  If you withdraw, you close off the possibility of playing \nthrough either of the two sides.  Then, depending on which you sided \nwith, you come to a final stage that is the same.  Let me show:\n\n          Learn of Conflict\n    Barbarian     |     Cleric\n    Barbarian  Neither  Cleric\n    Barbarian     |     Cleric\n           Siege Castle      \n\nNow, if you side with the barbarians, when you come to siege the \ncastle, a barbarian horde from the northern steppes will cut off the \ncastle&#39;s reinforcements.  But if you side with the clerics, you will \nhave a small squad helping you, which due to its campaign-outfitting, \nwill provide you with some food and potions as well.\n\nSo this would work like this:\n\nLevel 0: LoC  Exits: B1, C1, Neither\nLevel 1: LoC (Backed Out)  Exits: Neither\nLevel 2: B1   Exits: Level 1, B2\nLevel 3: B2   Exits: B1, B3\nLevel 4: B3   Exits: CastleB\nLevel 5: CastleB  Exits: B3 (When all foes dead, automatically win, \ngo to Cleared Castle)\nLevel 6: C1   Exits: Level 1, C2\nLevel 7: C2\n..\nLevel 9: CastleC  Exits: C3 (When all foes dead, ...)\nLevel 10: Neither  Exits: Level 1, CastleN\nLevel 11: CastleN Exits (...)\nLevel 12: Cleared Castle  Exits (only forward)\n\nSome other ideas:\nAn assassination mission.  Put all of the starting team spots in an \narea with faerie attacks of high power (so all team members are \nfrozen).  Enclose this area.  Now put a thief outside of that, an NPC \nthief.  The level has a lot of enemies, too many for the thief to \nbeat, but one low level named character.  Kill that guy, the level is \nautomatically won.  This would be a level that emphasized stealth, \navoidance, and tactical bursts.\n\nKeep the town guarding hub, but have the other missions around it \nless cheesy.  Make each of them two or three levels long.  But make \nit so that when you clear any one of them, that&#39;s enough to trigger \nthe next plot moment -- thus you have to &quot;choose&quot; again.  \n\nHave some nice exploration stuff... maybe you get marooned in an area \nand need to figure out where to go next, and just get to wander four \nor five levels for a bit.\n\nLevel 5: C1   \n\n\n"}}
