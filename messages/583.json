Another attack for him would be &#39;Poison dart&#39;.  Once you get\n&gt; him, you keep losing so many health points constantly until the\n&gt; character dies or you finish the scenario.\n\nYes, I like the idea of DoT (Damage over Time) attacks as well. Also, we\nshould concentrate on attacks that really differ the Orc, and orc captian,\nand the Mage, and Archmage, plus add extra promotions ot other characters,\nSuch as High Priest (Upgrade from a cleric), or a Necromancer (Upgrade from\na skeleton)\n\nThis is another message sent by the infamous Ricky Der, The Legendary Light.\n\n\n\n"}}
