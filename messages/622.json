means it doesn&#39;t yet exist\n&quot;in these&quot; means i made it up\n* means an npc need&#39;s permission from a pc to use this\nif you need a clearer table e-mail me and i&#39;ll send you my excel file.\n\nI&#39;m gonna talk about this as if it will really happen because it does have a \npossibility of happening: if the editor goes well and we get privileges from \nFSGames we could make G:BF and then we would (hopefully) use this as a guide \nto make the characters. As you see, Tower, Golem, and Orc need more \nabilities, especially tower.\n\nI have two problems with this, the latter one the more important:\n\n1) I think there should have to be a set # of abilities for each character, \neither 3 or 4, and that each character should have only one ability with an \nalternate because as it is an Archer has 3 abilities while a Cleric has 7.\n\n2) A major problem with this is that whenever we add abilities to Ghost, \nSkeleton or Elemental we&#39;re giving just as big a boost to Clerics, Mages and \nArchmages, the 3 strongest characters (I don&#39;t include faerie on this list \nbecause druid&#39;s are due for a boost anyway). there are 3 ways of dealing \nwith this. we could:\n   A) get rid of all summon abilities except summon faerie and summon image. \nThis would also help solve the 1st problem but would seriously cripple an \ninteresting type of ability\n   B) leave Elemental, Ghost and Skeleton as they were in the last game, \nmake them unhireable or really cheap second tear characters\n   C) create 2 types of Elementals, Ghosts and Skeletons, a &#39;normal&#39; type \n(new one) and a &#39;summoned&#39; type (old one) this one is my preference because \nit keeps the new abilities but doesn&#39;t strengthen the already too-strong \ncharacters. The problem with this is that it complicates things for new \nplayers to have 2 types of the same character running around.\n\non my excel file i also include info about the group three characters which \ni won&#39;t include here cuz it takes up too much room. But i think that the \nrule about having 3-4 abilities per character should apply to them too. i \nwill start here with my goblin:\n\nattack 1: suicidal charge*: doubles your attack and speed for the duration. \nat the end of the attack you die. if you finish the level in the middle of \nthe attack you survive\n\nattack 2: taunt: like thief but without reverse\n\nattack 3: battle cry: adds to your hp (the # of team members x your level)\n\n1 problem with having so many new characters is that all the choices will \nconfuse newbee&#39;s, so maybe you should only start with the ability to hire \ncharacters that are available in the unregistered version and get a new \ncharacter every 1 or 2 levels.\n\ni don&#39;t thing the practical mage or high priest characters are a good idea \nbecause again they are improving an already too good character type. On the \nother hand something like assassin (from thief) would be very good. i would \nhave nothing against practical mage being a hired character class. Assassin: \nthrows knives like a thief\n\nattack 1: drop caltraps: like drop bomb only deals less damage and is \npermanent, dealing damage to everyone who steps in the square. You could \nprogram npc&#39;s not to go around a square with them because they were very \nhard to see.\n\nattack 2: cloak: same as thief\n\nattack 3: Pick lock: opens any door\n\nattack 4: back stab: only works when invisible (cloaked or potion); doubles \nthe attack for 1 attack then he looses his invisibility (maybe only if he \nwas cloaked)\n\nNow the programming project:\n\nSadly, I have absolutely no knowledge of any programming languages but as i \nsaid before i can be a tester. i don&#39;t have much experience with that either \nbut i know quite a few people that have played glad before  who could test \nit as well.  I also have an unused web page on homestead that we could use \nto put up the editor on-line.\n\nif we do make G:BF i could help with the nonprograming designing.\n\nThis was the longest letter i&#39;ve ever written to this group. i hope to be \nvery active for the next month but then i&#39;m going to America for a month and \nmay not be able to get web access very much (poor country, you know).\n\n\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
