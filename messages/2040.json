I would like to \nset up a way to view maps like the one I put up in my web site.\n  \n\n&gt; depends what kinds of tools/software you have available.  What \nexactly did you have in mind?\n\nSomething similiar to the setup for the Gladiator File checker.  \nBasically, the script would read the map file and produce a picture \nof what the map looks like (similiar to what I&#39;ve done on my website \nwith the maps of scenarios: \nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/SCEN250.html \nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/SCEN116.html \nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/SCEN0389.html\n)\n\nJust a way to preview the map.  All you would need is all the map \ntile pics in the same folder so that you could display the map like \nI have it.\n\nUntil somebody comes along who understands more about graphics and \nhow to merge pics together in a program, this is the closest thing \nwe have to exporting maps for general view.\n\n\n"}}
