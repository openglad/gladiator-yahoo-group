I was thinking about taking\n&gt; the average experience level of the saved game team, mutiplying that\n&gt; by 3/4 to come up with approximate experience level numbers for your\n&gt; opposition.\n&gt; \n&gt; This something I&#39;d really like to have: characters in scenarios whose\n&gt; strength is always a close approximation to your own team.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is an idea for Open Glad Enhanced, essentially producing dynamic\n&gt; scenarios where it plays well for a beginner team and adjusts itself\n&gt; to be harder for a well-experienced team.\n\n\n"}}
