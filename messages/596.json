Beyond \nthat, talk about Parts 1-3 is encouraged.\n\nThe point of multiple parts is to keep discussion going at a steady \npace [If it was just one giant wish list for everything, conversation \nprobably would have died out by now].  When I switch to a higher part \nnumber, it means that I thought conversation about the current part \nwas almost dead and I attempted to keep the mailing list active again \nby starting the next part.  So far, my strategy has been working for \nbringing this mailing list to a more active state.  In fact, we have \nsurpassed previous records for number posts in a month at yahoo.  \nFrankly, I hope discussion about part 4 will drag on and on and on and \non and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on . . .\n\nI do have a new topic planned for what happens when part 4 is \nexhausted.  Just don&#39;t ask me what comes after that topic because \nfrankly, after that topic, I will be out of ideas except to recycle \nprevious topics unless the tournament falls through.  BTW, if someone \nwants to bring something else up, feel free.  My goal is to keep this \nlist somewhat active.\n\nAlso a reminder:  15 people need to show interest in a tournament \nbefore I will start work on that.  I have asked Tom Ricket to put \nsomething on the FSGames website about a possible tournament.\n\nOne more requested feature:\n\nSearch and replace objects.  Sometimes, I decide my opponents are \neither too weak or too strong and it would be very convient if I do a \nquick update on experience levels without having to delete lots of \ncharacters.\n\n\n"}}
