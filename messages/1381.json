Instead of making a clone from scratch, we could then\nport it to SDL (or some other cross-platform graphics library) and improve\nit from there.\n\n\nAlso,\n\nOn Mon, 17 Jun 2002, dph_of_rules wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I would like to have access to enough of the code to produce a/some\n&gt; new version(s) of the existing game.\n&gt;\n\nDph, if you want to help us out at the Gladiator clone project on\nSourceforge, you&#39;re very welcome to join. If you&#39;re intersted, make an\naccount on Sourceforge and email me or post to the forums or something,\nand I&#39;ll hook you up.\n\nThe same goes for anyone else interested to help. I think we&#39;ll get alot\nmore done if we&#39;re all working on one project instead of 2 or 3 different\nones.\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
