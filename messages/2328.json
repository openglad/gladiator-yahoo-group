Tha=\r\nt&#39;s a very big issue.  If I have\nthe image in a certain way to be able to c=\r\nhange color of the\ncharacter, . . that can get real fun.\n\n2)I can&#39;t seem to=\r\n find the code that lets a character walk in any\ndirection.  Without that, =\r\nI&#39;m at a little loss.\n\n3)I ran into a constant problem of reading strings f=\r\nrom binary files\nfrom Java.  Problem is there is no symmetry in the command=\r\ns. \nLiterally, Java has one command to write strings to binary files, but\nt=\r\nhe only way to read strings in is 1 character at a time.\n\n--- In gladiator@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Sean Ford&quot; &lt;aglswapbuffers@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I solved that =\r\nproblem all ready :)\n&gt; \n&gt; I wrote a C utility that converts PIX files to ta=\r\nrga (TGA) graphic\n&gt; files. You can use any graphics program to convert the =\r\ntga files to\n&gt; just about any other format.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are interested in i=\r\nt, its located in the Openglad-e SVN\n&gt; repository. SVN instructions can be =\r\nfound at:  \n&gt; http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=3D50083\n&gt; \n&gt; The C progr=\r\nam is located in openglad-e/trunk/util/convert.c. All the\n&gt; targa graphics =\r\nare located in openglad-e/trunk/pix. Note though that\n&gt; all the graphics ha=\r\nve an extra row of pixels at the top. We were going\n&gt; to use this row to st=\r\nore frame data for the animations (such as the\n&gt; number of frames in the an=\r\nimation), and all the color cycling data.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sean\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In gladiator@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;alternate_dph&quot; &lt;alternate_dph@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ran int=\r\no a small problem trying to work on the graphics, mainly\n&gt; &gt; figuring out h=\r\now the animation works in the game.  Plus I got to find\n&gt; &gt; a program to co=\r\nnvert pix files to gif files for java to handle it. \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m hoping to have=\r\n something ready by February 5.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
