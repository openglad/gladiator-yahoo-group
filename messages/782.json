Some thing \nlike \n&gt; &quot;Due to the magical nature of the halfling, split can be dangerous.&quot; \nor \n&gt; something like that. These are the numbers I think we should use in \nthe \n&gt; background(that the player won&#39;t know about of course)\n\n1st, the biggest proposal is limit who can become halfings.  IMHO, you \nshould only have halfings if both characters have reached a certain \nexperience level (15 or higher).  In addition, how about proposing a \ncost associated to creating halfings: it costs money to create a \nhalfings?  If we conviently ignore slimes from becoming potential \nhalfings, everybody is happy.  Incidently, last time I checked the \npoll, it was a dead for calling halfings either &#39;dual class&#39; or \n&#39;hybrids&#39;.\n\n\n"}}
