Archmages really should be \nrestricted in intelligence to prevent accidental spillovers in \nsummoning images/fire elementals.  At level 220, I can summon fire \nelementals that cross over with too much magic power.\n\nBeyond that, I am pretty sure with exactly 2 scenarios, that I reach  \nexperience levels above 100 and below 300.  \n\nIt is very difficult to get a character above 230 or so experience \nbecause of well thought financial difficulities and the amount of \nexperience it takes to get to the next level.  Good job guys in \npreventing the game from crashing.\n\nThanks for responding.\n\n\n"}}
