The second\none is four players, fullscreen at 1024x768.\n\nIt may look like regular old Openglad/Gladiator but a lot of the code\nhas been completely rewritten. Makes things a whole lot easier to work\nwith. I cringe everytime I look through the original Openglad code\nsince it is a mess. After all, it was pretty much just a port of\nGladiator. We didn&#39;t try to make it clean, or alter the code structure\nso it inherited much of Gladiator&#39;s messiness. I am not dissing the FS\nguys (sorry Tom :), they did an amazing job considering they were\nworking with DOS, but I doubt they thought other people would be going\nthrough their code years later. :P\n\nI am going back to UCSB tomorrow, but my class schedule is a lot less\ndemanding than last quarter so I am planning on getting a lot done in\nthe next couple weeks with Openglad-e.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
