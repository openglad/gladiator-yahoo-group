The mimic has no \nspecials except to duplicate anyone else&#39;s specials within a certain \nrange.  The only catch would be it could only duplicate specials if it \nhad the stats to do so.  Ideally, you would fight this character from \nlong range and never, ever, let is get close to a mage, cleric, or \narchmage.  The most dangerous thing out there is a mage who can freeze \ntime and also has lots of poitions of magic.\n\nThat leads me to another class, which is the only class that will \nbreak the rule about max of 4 specials plus alternates:\nChemist- Ability to create potions, all 5 of them.  I am putting these \nin order from weakest to strongest, IMHO.  His basic attack is a small \nknife.  His 1st special is speed potion.  the Alternate is create a \nspeed poition, which requires level 25 intelligence.  the 2nd special \nis potion of flight, wich requires level 4 experience.  The alternate \nrequires the same amount of experience, plus level 50 intelligence and \nis create a potion of flight.  The 3rd special is potion of magic, \nwhich requires experience level 6.  The alternate is create a potion \nof magic, which in addition, requires level 75 intelligence.  The 4th \nspecial is potion of invisibility, which requires experience level 8. \n The alternate is create a potion of invisibility and requires \nintelligence level 100.  The 5th special is potion of invulnerability \nand requires experience level 10.  The alternate is create a potion of \ninvulnerability and requires intelligence level 125.\n\n\n"}}
