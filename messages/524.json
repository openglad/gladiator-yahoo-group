I would expect the judges to post the stats for \neach person&#39;s team once everybody has turned the stats in at each \nstop point.  If anyone looking at the stats thought somebody was \ncheating, somebody could always challenge and a judge would work \nthrough the scenarios with the given team to check for cheating.  I \nwould propose making sure that it would extremely difficult to end up \nwith an archmage (that could summon either images or fire elementals) \nby going through the tournament scenarios and give extra points to \nteams that do NOT use clerics.\n\nTwo obvious questions remain:  How many people would be interested in \na tournament (no entry fee with no prizes) and how many scenarios \nwould be in this tournament?  I will like to a stipulation: no \ntournament unless 15 or more people are involved.\n\nI am dead set against having closed discussions about a proposed \ntournament and its proposed rules.\n\n\n"}}
