Votes only.  Votes will be \ntaken by emailing this group with either a yes or no vote for each \nsection of rules or a yes or no vote for the entire set of rules.  \nAnybody may vote (including those who worked on the rules).  Violation \nof these conditions will result in a mild form of punishment.  \nQuestions about clarification of each proposed rule are allowed as \nlong as no comment about the proposed rule is made.  \n\nexample of something not allowed:  &quot;I&#39;d vote for this rule if it means \n. . .&quot;.\n\nexample of something allowed: &quot;How does this specific rules apply in \nthis condition?&quot;\n\n**PROPOSED RULES OF THE TOURNAMENT\n\nObjective of the tournament: The objective is to score the maximum    \npoints possible in the tournament scenarios without cheating.  In the \nevent of a tie, the following list will be used to settle ties:\n1)a tie breaker scenario.  In this scenario you will be pitted against \n  a team that is a computer duplicate of your own characters with the \n  same amount of experience as each character has.  You will not be   \n  allowed to hire extra characters for the tie-breaker scenario.\n2)the team with no clerics\n3)the team with no ghosts \n4)the team with no faeries \n5)the team with no elves \n6)the team with no mages  \n7)the team with no skeletons\n                 \nScenario information: There will be 20 scenarios in this tournament.  \nPlayers will be given 1 week to complete 5 scenarios.  Every time a  \nplayer has completed 5 scenarios, he/she must send the saved game to  \nevery judge for evaluation and must wait a day after the stats of all \nplayers are posted before going onward.\n\nCheating, Part 1: After all of the players have completed each set of \n5 scenarios, the stats for each team will be posted.  If any person \nfeels one player has cheated to achieve certain stats, then that \nplayer may challenge another person&#39;s score.  Once a challenge is \nissued, the tournament is temporarily stopped until the judges can \nmake a ruling about the accused cheater.\n\nCheating, Part 2:What constitutes cheating?  Using cheat codes to help \ngo through the tournament, playing through scenarios not in the \ntournament set, tampering with the saved game file, breaking any \ntournament rules, and anything else that is used to enhance a player&#39;s \nscore besides playing through tournament scenarios.  Anyone caught \ncheating will immediately be expelled from the tournament.\n\nJudges: There will be a minimium of 3 judges.  Each judge will receive \nthe saved games and use information in the saved game to post stats \nfor players in the gladiator group.  In addition, if anyone challenges \nanother person&#39;s score, the judges will work through the scenarios to \ndetermine whether or not cheating occured.  If the judges determine \ncheating has occured, they do have the power to expell someone from \nthe tournament.\n\nExtra Rule 1: No hiring any new characters after completing the 5th \nscenario unless a character dies.  In such a case, the player may only \nhire the number of characters that have died and the characters that \nare bought must be of the same character type that died.\n\nExtra Rule 2: Each team must be composed of a minimium of 4 \ncharacters.\n\nExtra Rule 3:Each team may possess no more than 20 characters.\n\n\n"}}
