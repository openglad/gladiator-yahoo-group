It would still have the basic teleport abilities.  This one \ncould teleport teammates and as an alternate teleport enemies.  Also, \nthis one could freeze time, and as an alternate slow down time for \nenemies.  It could create teleporters and as an alternate create\nblack \n holes.  The black holes would kill enemies and teammates alike when \nthey entered it.\n\nI noticed a mage&#39;s magical bolts are more powerfull than a heartburst \nattack because a heartburst attack takes more energy to kill a \ncharacter.\n\n\n"}}
