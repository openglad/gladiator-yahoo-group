As you may know, Gladiator originally intended to\n&gt; h=\r\nave six special abilities for every class, but, of course, that never\n&gt; hap=\r\npened.(The only class with six abilities is the mage.) So, I just\n&gt; wanted =\r\nto ask what would be some of your ideas for special abilities\n&gt; on the clas=\r\nses?\n&gt; \n&gt; One I thought of that they sort of did, most likely by error, is\n=\r\n&gt; exploding fire arrows for the archer. Anyways, just wanted to hear\n&gt; your=\r\n ideas.\n\nGo to the Files Section -&gt; Char Info folder for where we started.\n=\r\n\nhttp://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/gladiator/message/2284 &lt;- summary\nof  =\r\nmy policy about file uploads.

I&#39;m\ntrying to work on building gladiator in =\r\nJava.  Currently, I&#39;m working\non the map issue(s).\n\n\n"}}
