Worse problem: there are 8 \nteams in the scenario and each one has a mage capable of slowing down \ntime.  How would that problem be handled?\n\nAnother thing to consider is making the time slow down delay before \nusing it again effect the entire team.  What if team 1 had 3 mages?  \nEffectively, team 1 could rotate out who slows down time to keep time \nindefinitely frozen.\n\n\n"}}
