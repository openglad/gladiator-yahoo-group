You try destroying over half the rocks in \nsomething as large as scenario #1 if it is pretty full of rocks.  You \ncan not destroy enough of them to make dent in the situation I was \ndealing with (that was with less than 100 elves).  Heck, I had level \n1023 doors (the highest level number doors you can have without \ngetting error messages) protecting almost all of the scenario (except \nfor walls) and left very little room for elves to appear.  They opened \nevery door and my fire elementals did not have a prayer.\n\nWhat does it take to destroy a large slime with one blow?  I do not \nmean make the slime lose one size.  I have had slime that manage to \ngrow just in time to avoid being killed if they were small.  I am \ntalking about exploding arrows.  No matter how powerfull I have had of \nan archer, no archer I have had can seemingly take out a large slime \nwith 1 exploding bolt.  If the slime is good, you can waste all kinds \nof magic energy without killing the stupid [seeming indestructible] \nslime.  Or maybe that only happens with friendly fire?\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Tom Tildrum&quot; &lt;Tevildo@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dude, you can just shoot the rocks and they disappear.\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
