When I make levels, I cannot run \nthem.  I save the level&#39;s grid and scen as 99, title as 99 (For level \n99).  The names are all 99.   Then, when I try to run it, it gives me a \nweird version of level 1.  How should I be saving/running the level?\n\n\n--\nSgMitchell\nsmitchell@...\n\n\n\n"}}
