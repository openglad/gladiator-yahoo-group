It&#39;s too damn easy to screw the file up.\n2)Read comment 1 again.\n3)Always keep track of what byte number you are on when adding or \ndeleting objects by code.\n4)Read comment 3 again.  When I first attempted to delete files, I \nforgot to do this and ended up screwing a file up.\n5)Always keep track of variable types when adding or modifying objects \nby code.  If the information you read was one type of variable, then \nwhen you put into that same information into a new file, it should be \nthe exact same variable type.\n6)Read comment 5 again.  I forgot to do this when adding objects and \ngot extremely frustrated trying to find the problem in my code.\n7)read these comments again before proceeding.\n \n\n**Comments about 1st section of code\n\nintCounter is used to keep track of the byte number in the original \nfile.  intCount3 is used to keep track of the byte number in the new \nfile.

If by now, you haven&#39;t updated the \nnumber of objects in the new file, it would be a good idea to do so \nnow BEFORE proceeding to handle the text.  Yes, I don&#39;t have to keep \ntrack of the number of new objects at this point, but I do prefer to \nin case I ran into problems.\n \n**comments about 5th section of code**\n\nYou&#39;ve all seen it before.

I am posting code to remove \nthe mystery of how to do things to a scenario file by code.\n\nYes, the code I have posted was used to help me fix my scenarios.  I \nhave one left that I plan on working on.  I going to post to code to \nsolve that problem because it involves adding, deleting, and modifying \nobjects all at once.  Once I finish that, I&#39;ll start working on \nwriting code to sort objects (I hope I can remember how to sort \nefficiently.).  Meanwhile at that point, I&#39;ll be working on my own \nscenario converter/editor implementing the cool features of adding, \nmodifying, and deleting objects wide-scale.\n\n\n"}}
