So, although maybe not as powerful as archmagi, the archer \nis cheap and effective. Like said before, all classes have their powers, be \nit their so cheap you could buy enough to swarm any enemy or that they can \nbust threw opposing lines if enough money is invested in them.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
