Here&#39;s another attack \nfor the fire elemental: giant fireball.\n\nOne goal of mine is for every character to have at least 3 attacks.\n\nHere&#39;s 2 for a slime: Combine.  Only works for 2 small slimes.  When \nthey combine, the new experience level is equal to 3/4 of the combined \nexperience level.  The other attack for slime would be Digestion.  The \nslime sends out digestive fluids as an attack.\n\nBarbarian - Striking hammer.  The character hits the ground with his \nhammer, all opponents within a certain proximity and a a straight line \nfrom him get attacked.  The alternate for this one would be the same \nexcept the attack heads out in all 8 directions.\n\nGhost - I still like the idea of possession.  I would like to add this \n twist - If a ghost and a sketelon are on the same team, they can \ncombine to form a random character (not ghost or skeleton).  The new \nexperience level is 3/4 of the combined.\n\n\n"}}
