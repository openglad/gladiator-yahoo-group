Basically, you get a \nroughly n^2 (n-squared) processing time value, because each lightning \nobject checks each possible enemy to see where it should head next, \netc.  Thus, shooting it out when there are, say, 15 total characters on the \nscreen means a processing &quot;cost&quot; of around 225; bump that up to 50 \ncharacters and you&#39;re up to 2500; move that up to 150 characters and you&#39;re \nat 22500 -- 100x more processing time than with 15 characters.\n\nOf course, on fast systems (remember, Gladiator was programmed to run on a \n286 or 386, so a p3 or p4 system is really fast for it!) plus enough real \nmemory to keep everything local (without swapping to the hard drive or \npage-switching), that won&#39;t really matter, since even a heavily-bogged down \nGladiator is still only taking up 10-20% of your computer&#39;s efforts.\n\n--Tom\n\nAt 01:18 PM 6/25/2001, you wrote:\n&gt;The algorithm they are using is likely inefficient and has a very high\n&gt;running cost, although it would have to be extreemely high cost and\n&gt;extreemely inefficient to choke a 1GHz with only a handful (10-20) of\n&gt;opponents.\n&gt;There&#39;s any number of reasons why its inefficient, the only people that know\n&gt;anything about it are the programmers that wrote it :)\n&gt;\n&gt;However if the Forgotten Sages released the code for just the routine chain\n&gt;lightning uses we should be able to improve it.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Deathifier\n&gt;\n&gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt;From: &lt;DanielBook@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 1:12 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 3\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In a message dated 6/24/2001 2:09:04 PM Central Daylight Time,\n&gt; &gt; dph_of_rules@... writes:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Archmages have chain-lightning and it is so badly coded that it isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt;  funny.  Chain lightning will basically slow down any computer (trust\n&gt; &gt;  me, I&#39;ve tried it with 1 ghz and 128 meg of RAM) to a halt if you use\n&gt; &gt;  it against more than 15-20 opponents. &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How it slows down your computer I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve used chain lighting\n&gt; &gt; against hundreds of foes at once with a 1.1 ghz with 128 megs of ram\n&gt;without any slowdown whatsoever.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n"}}
