When I make levels, I cannot run\n&gt;them.  I save the level&#39;s grid and scen as 99, title as 99 (For level\n&gt;99).  The names are all 99.   Then, when I try to run it, it gives me a\n&gt;weird version of level 1.  How should I be saving/running the level?\n\nIt&#39;s possible you have a pre-existing level 99 in your directory (what \nhappens when you try to load it with the editor?) .. try naming it \nsomething like 154 (or other random number below 500) and see if that gives \nyou any better results.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
