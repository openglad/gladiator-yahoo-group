I am more than happy to be\r\ndoing this but I&#39;m a human being and school is\r\ngoing to be starting up soon which means I&#39;ll be\r\nhaving less and less time (my senior year).\r\n\r\nIf you guys already have some levels done, great!\r\nSend them along to my email address (which is,\r\nshayd@...) and not the list itself and\r\nI will get back to you.\r\n\r\nIf you have an idea for a level or are in the\r\nprocess of making a cluster (or a single Glad\r\nscenario) PLEASE tell me first if you want the\r\nlevel to be included on my list.  The reason I am\r\nasking you all of this is that some of your levels\r\nmay be using the same filenames as levels that\r\nhave been sent in by other people.  Specify how\r\nmany rooms you expect your set of scenarios to be\r\nand I will assign you with numbers that you can\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe above is only if you want you Gladiator\r\nscenarios included on my list.  If you&#39;re making\r\nthem for yourself and close friends only, hell if\r\nI care (but you might want to confer just in case\r\nan upcoming scenario will be lost or will over-\r\nwrite the scenario you make).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll be redoing my page soon to be easier for\r\nplayers with non-frame interfaces or slower\r\nconnections to be navigate through by use of\r\ntables and less graphics, but this won&#39;t be done\r\nuntil I get the list going.\r\n\r\nIf any of this is unclear to any of you feel free,\r\nonce again, to drop me a letter.\r\n\r\n-Chris/Shayd\r\n    http://plaza.v-wave.com/shayd/\r\n    ICQ# : 18074806\r\n\r\nPS\r\nOh, and Tom (and the rest of FSGames)-- I got\r\nEnder&#39;s Game, that book is *awesome*.
