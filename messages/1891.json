And\nwe&#39;ve pretty much relied on the goodwill of customers all these years to not\nsend the registered version around without a password (since it&#39;d be easy\nenough to do), and haven&#39;t had any problems.\n\n--Tom\n\n&gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; From: Patrick Wong [mailto:SSFSX17@...]\n&gt; Sent: Monday, July 28, 2003 7:50 AM\n&gt; To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Help Me Download\n&gt; \n&gt; Re: All this stuff about d/ling the original version:\n&gt; \n&gt; Are the creators still around? Is there a chance that\n&gt; we can ask them about what to do?\n&gt; \n&gt; If they don&#39;t respond after, say, about five years\n&gt; straight of trying to contact them, I think we can\n&gt; apply &quot;abandonware&quot; principles, a la The Home of the\n&gt; Underdogs. If they do respond, however, we will\n&gt; default to their decision.\n&gt; \n&gt; __________________________________\n&gt; Do you Yahoo!?\n&gt; Yahoo!
