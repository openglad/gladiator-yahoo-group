I said that it was a virus, and that&#39;s what it =\r\nwas.\nI never executed the program to get the information that I got from it=\r\n.\n\nWhat you just said made it sound like you INTENTIONALLY sent it for the\n=\r\nsole purpose of harming others&#39; computers.\n\nThe question is: WHY the heck d=\r\nid you post it to the group?\n\nFirst of all, you shouldn&#39;t have done that ju=\r\nst because what it was\nCLAIMING to do was _ILLEGAL_... if you&#39;ve been aroun=\r\nd for a while, you&#39;ll\nknow Seth/Tom have removed several people asking for =\r\nwarez. How would this\nhave been any different?\n\nSecondly, you never virus-s=\r\ncanned it before sending it to the group -- that\nmuch is obvious, too!\n\n&gt;Do=\r\nes anyone else have levels sitting around? I know Shayd tried to \n\nI was wo=\r\nrking on a set a while back, but... frankly, it&#39;s too difficult to\nuse the =\r\neditor effectively.. I mean, I&#39;d be fine if it were text-based or\nif it wer=\r\ne a windows executable or if it had instructions or if it didn&#39;t\ncrash all =\r\nthe time (well, on my one system, at any rate)...\n\nmmm.. text-based... actu=\r\nally, that might not be a bad idea..\n\n*starts daydreaming*\n\n...Write a text=\r\n-based version of the program..\n...Where you use the arrow keys to move the=\r\n cursor around the map (with a\ndisplay of 80x23 or something, with 2 lines =\r\nfor status/etc..\n...Obviously scrolling when you got to the edge of the scr=\r\neen) and then you\njust press the letter of the type of thing you want there=\r\n...\n...&quot;W&quot; for wall... &quot;C&quot; for carpet... &quot;T&quot; for tree &quot;t&quot; for teleport... e=\r\ntc.. :)\n...And since there are multiple tiles in some cases, the program wo=\r\nuld\nrandomly select WHICH specific tile to use there... yeah... :D~~~\n...He=\r\ny, Tom, you go the map specs onhand? :) he he he...\n\n*ends daydreaming*\n\nSe=\r\nriously, the way the GUI is implemented and the difficulty of selecting\nspe=\r\ncific tiles made it a bit painful to deal with. :/\n\n&gt;And does anyone know w=\r\nhat the heck DAYOFDRA.MOD is?

Custom intruments, and more\nmusic=\r\nal &#39;things&#39; can be done. Also in existance are S3M, IT, and XM files\nwith m=\r\nore channels and more nifty features for composers..\n-Cookie\n\n\n"}}
