In\ngeneral this doesn&#39;t have much of an effect, although it is writing out a\n12th garbage character from who knows where (potential for it to crash).\n\nI&#39;ve decided that with uni holidays approaching I&#39;ll put off releasing an\nupdate (I fixed the bug already, so if you are concerned I&#39;ll upload it\nagain) until after I&#39;ve gone through the scenario class and cleaned it up a\nfair bit - something that will help a lot with the final editor (provided\nits written it in C++) and as a side effect also with porting, even though\nthat isn&#39;t needed :)\n\nJust thought I&#39;d let you all know about it, this might also explain some of\nthe quirky behaviour (it does read and write the correct number of bytes,\njust doesn&#39;t store them all) that DPH was reporting.\n\nWill keep ya&#39;s posted once I get to working on it again (sometime in the\nmiddle of November).\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
