He/she will \ninitially have an experience level 100 and then will jump to \nexperience level 200.  I will be pitting this person against an evil \narchmage (who needs a name) who is experience level 150-175.  I just \nhope no person goes through that scenario (with the archmage) with a \nlarge army or game crashes might occur.\n\nTo balance out the scales, I plan on leaving blood spots around as \nwell tents and bonepiles.\n\nBy the way, I have finished all scenarios up to #159 of my set.  6 \nmore scenarios to go!!  I never plan on trying to complete another set \nof scenarios by myself.\n\n\n"}}
