What\n&gt; I\n&gt; &gt; want to know is why we need a new editor.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well I belive the purpose of the new editor is simply to make it \nsimpler to\n&gt; use and provide extra features.\n&gt; Everything may well be possible with the existing editors, and from \nthe\n&gt; feature list I&#39;ve got we are not actually adding much extra, however \nthe\n&gt; thing is there are 2 files, their interface requires a lot of time \nto learn\n&gt; and there are a collection of things that can be done to speed up \nscenario\n&gt; creation.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the interface was easier to use then people that thought &quot;Hey \nit&#39;d be\n&gt; cool to write a scenario about blah blah blah...&quot; could fire it up, \nfollow a\n&gt; couple of tutorials and experiment and produce something.\n&gt; The time-saving features mean that more experienced people can \nproduce more\n&gt; faster, can afford to make more mistakes, and can update their \nscenarios,\n&gt; and don&#39;t have to worry so much about (re-)numbering - which, as I \ngather,\n&gt; is rather painful and time-consuming to do at the moment.\n\nVery painfully to set level numbers for any object.  You can currently \nuse only your bracket keys to increase and decrease level numbers.  On \na 100mhz, this can be annoying getting to certain numbers at times.  \nOn a 1 ghz, this can be frustrating.  Suppose you have an exp level 12 \ncharacter and you want to change that character to experience level \n10.  To do so, you would have to delete the old character, and create \na new character with the exp level.  I consider this almost \nridiculiously slow.  Hmm.  If I was pretty good at imagining x and y \ncoordinates on a grid, I might be tempted to write a small VB program \njust to allow me to update objects.\n\n\n"}}
