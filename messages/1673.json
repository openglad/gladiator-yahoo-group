Implementing a way for team 1 to\n  &gt; have time slowed down while team 2 also has time slowed down while\n  &gt; team 3 also has time slowed down . . basically, it can get\n  &gt; interesting.  For example, suppose every team except numbers 7 & 8\n  &gt; have time slowed down.  How exactly do you calculate how fast team\n  &gt; numbers 7 & 8 work and be equitable to everybody else?\n\n  well, you could have it be like a counterspell for your team, if someone else \n  has already cast it.  ie, team 1 casts it, so everyone else slows down, then \n  some guy on team 2 casts it, and team 2 speeds back up to normal, while all \n  other teams remain slowed. That seems like it should work. \n  Bjorn\n\n        Yahoo! Groups Sponsor \n              ADVERTISEMENT\n             \n       \n       \n\n  The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
