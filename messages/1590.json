Now I\nhave a slight problem, I downloaded the Windows version of Openglad .95, but\nI just can&#39;t get it to run on my machine...  guess I&#39;ll toy with it a bit,\nbut I would love to see it working.\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Zardus@... \n  To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, November 08, 2002 2:03 AM\n  Subject: Re: [gladiator] Whoa\n\n\n  Openglad is the open sourced version of Gladiator. A bunch of people\n  created a group called Snowstorm Entertainment and started up a project to\n  make a clone of Gladiator. Someone found the project, posted it here,\n  then Tom Ricket saw it and open sourced Gladiator. Snowstorm changed their\n  goal from cloning to porting the old Gladiator to modern operating\n  systems, and Openglad was born.\n\n  Openglad runs on 5 OS&#39;es (Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, BeOS, and Windows) and\n  currently features slightly better graphics (on everything but BeOS) and\n  better joystick handling (at least under Linux) than the original. Work is\n  currently underway for a modern graphic format, resolution options, and\n  class scripting. We&#39;ll get to other things later, too.\n\n  Bjorn already posted the site URL, so go check it out. Its pretty cool :-)\n\n  - Zardus\n\n\n  On Wed, 6 Nov 2002, shigtree wrote:\n\n  &gt; I was just browsing the web-site (long time registered member), and\n  &gt; for fun&lt; I wanted to see if the yahoo group still existed, and yay,\n  &gt; apparently it does.
