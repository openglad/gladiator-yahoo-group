It should arrive sometime in the next couple of weeks (had it mailed from home) and then maye I&#39;ll have some time and we could actually start doing some stuff on the editor.  We do need to figgure out how to split up the work though.  I don&#39;t really have much of a clue about building windows and displaying things in them still but maybe one of these days I can get a grip on that.  Anyway once my computer gets here I&#39;ll take a more careful look at the design specs that we made and let you know what parts I feel comfortable with.  Now if only my course load will co-operate. . .\n\n\nBjï¿½rn\n\n\n\n"}}
