Obviously, the problem is I&#39;m dealing wit=\r\nh &quot;integer\nmath&quot;.  It&#39;s the same type of problem I have when slopes of line=\r\ns\naren&#39;t &#39;good&#39; numbers.\n\nI still haven&#39;t tried to work on creating a data =\r\nfile to store the\nrules for the smoother function.  \n\nIt&#39;s relatively easy =\r\nto code tile-replacement methods when compared to\nfiguring how to store dat=\r\na.  One quarter of the work is creating the\nform, half the work is coding t=\r\nhe validation rules to make the form\nmore error proof, and the other quarte=\r\nr is actually implementating the\nidea from the user data.\n\nNow, I&#39;m going t=\r\no work on the hardest thing: creating a tool to draw\nan unfilled polygon in=\r\nside a map - the catch is the polygon can have a\nvirtually infinite number =\r\nfor sides if I can code it right.  It&#39;s\ngoing to be based on entering coord=\r\ninates for the corners of the\npolygon - just an extension of my line drawin=\r\ng function.\n\nOh yea, I just passed the 200kb mark for the size of my compil=\r\ned\nscenario editor.  Currently it has 1 main form connected to 7 others.  \n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
