(Of course an archer or mage \ncan just fire at the rocks until they disappear, but a cleric is helpless. \nBlobs and towers are pretty harmless if you&#39;re careful, but one hit from a \nhigh-level tower can kill a careless player, and blobs are durned hard to \ndamage. As far as one-on-one combat goes, I think that skeletons and fairies \nare the weakest. A skeleton can chase you around throwing bones and such, \nbut if you face it in close combat it&#39;s pretty hard to lose. Fairies, even \nthe highest level fairies, do little damage hand-to-hand. Remember \nTinkerhew, from TevFifty? A pushover. (That is, unless it freezes you long \nenough for the golems to throw some rocks at you... ugh.)\n\nDPH... I&#39;ve been too busy with websites to try your latest levels (I have to \nopen them all in Scen and rename them as my characters have already done \nlevels with those numbers). I will soon, though, and give you my critique.\n\nDid anyone take my suggestion about Gladiator fan-fics? I haven&#39;t started \nmine, but I will soon. I promise.\n\n  -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
