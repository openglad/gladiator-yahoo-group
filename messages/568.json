Using\nstandard C++ means it will then be compileable on a wide range of compilers.\nI take it the editor will be a native Win32 application, which just means\nthat anyone without MVC++ will need the windows platform SDK and set it up -\nno big hassle, I know at least one free compiler (DJGPP) that runs in both\nDOS and Windows that can do it.\n\nI&#39;d like to help out with development, it looks like we&#39;ve already got few\nothers too :)\nMost of the stuff I&#39;ve done is available at www.twarriors.com/downloads.html\nThe most recent and complete is the &quot;Timing Assistant&quot;, but the rest of them\nwork (they just don&#39;t have everything implemented) just fine, and one of\nthem has the source code available.\nAside from Win32 development I can also create a help file for the editor :)\n\nThats all from me,\nDeathifier\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
