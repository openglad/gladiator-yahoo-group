The problem with \nthem\n&gt;  is\n&gt;  that, like clerics, they aren&#39;t great if the computer is controlling them.\n&gt;  They\n&gt;  are very good if you are controlling them and no how forever.  Here&#39;s one\n&gt;  strategy I like to use with early-on thieves (works insanely well in the\n&gt;  slime\n&gt;  level).\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Drop a bomb, or a cluster of bombs -- however many your intelligence allows\n&gt;  you to make.  Throw a few knives at a nearby foe and wait for him to attack\n&gt;  you.  Run backwards, standing past the bombs, and wait for your foe to walk\n&gt;  over them.  If your foe is fast, you have to use the circle and strike\n&gt;  method,\n&gt;  which is a tad more difficult. :\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Say you are fighting a skeleton, or a group of them. They aren&#39;t very \nhardy,\n&gt;  but\n&gt;  they certainly are fast -- faster than your thief.  You aren&#39;t having a lot\n&gt;  of luck\n&gt;  dropping bombs and luring them into your trap, so you have to change your\n&gt;  strategy.  Bring some enemies to your cluster of bombs and begin circling\n&gt;  them,\n&gt;  keeping the circle small enough so that the enemy will stay on the bombs,\n&gt;  turning occasionally to toss a bone at you.  Eventually, the bombs will go\n&gt;  off\n&gt;  and harm your enemy.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  ---\n&gt;  \n&gt;  This is the strategy that has made thieves one of the more useful classes\n&gt;  for me.\n&gt;  That and their ability to go invisible whenever you so please (so long as\n&gt;  you&#39;ve\n&gt;  got the intelligence to stay in those shadows) as well as a poison cloud\n&gt;  that can\n&gt;  be used similarly to bombs, except it does perpetual damage.  If you&#39;re \nused\n&gt;  to\n&gt;  using a thief, and practice a lot, you can send him or her into the enemy&#39;s\n&gt;  reproduction zones (with towers, bone piles, skeleton tents and whatnot) \nand\n&gt;  \n&gt;  bomb the bajeebers out of those guys, helping your team out considerably.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  Because of their speed, you can also leave thieves alone if you&#39;re fighting\n&gt;  slower enemies like elves.\n\nOne way I have found to be really effective with the thieves is that I get \ntheir intelligence up really high at the beginning.  Then I go into battle \nand make about 2 of my other guys (probably soldiers with a lot of \nconstitution) just start beating on the other team.  Then since the soldiers \nare beating up on them, they are trying to kill the soldiers, right?  So I \njust go up to the closest one, throw a knife, and lure them onto me.  So now \none of them is following me (my thief) and the rest are on my soldiers.  Then \nI start running south away from the one enemy that&#39;s lured onto me, then I \nwait until they are only so close to me while I am running:\n    Fast Speed Creatures - about 3-4 spaces above my view window\n    Moderate Speed Creatures - at the very top of my view window\n    Slow Speed Creatures - about 3-4 spaces below the top of my view window\n\nI wait until that point and then I just lay down as many bombs as I can in a \nrow.  I continue running south and the enemy goes right into the middle of \nall those bombs and most of time just dies, right there.  And, if he doesn&#39;t, \nI just dodge him, go north, and repeat the process until he&#39;s dead.  Then I \nthrow a knife at another guy that&#39;s picking on my soldiers and do the same, \nand so on and so forth.\n\n--Tristan\n\n"}}
