It would put all objects that are similiar\n&gt; (for example, player 1 positions) all close together to make it easier\n&gt; to see where the possible player start positions are.  This would have\n&gt; to be done where the player positions stay in the same order they were\n&gt; before, but they would all be close together.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
