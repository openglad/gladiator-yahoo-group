For now, anyone can look up \nmessage archives.\n\nMembership will be by approval of the moderator.  No deadbeat members \nwill be allowed in this group.\n\nWhy a separate group?  One reason: just to get work done on a \ntournament without boring other people who don&#39;t care about the \ninternal workings of a tournament.\n\nThe location is groups.yahoo.com/group/glad-tourny .  I will be \nchecking potential members of this new group to see if there are \nmembers of this group.  If you are not a member of this group, denial \nof membership of the new group is certain.\n\n\n"}}
