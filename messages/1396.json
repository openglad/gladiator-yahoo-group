PLEASE read gladiator_story.rtf. failure to do so will result in a gang of blood-thirsty orcs coming into your house, howling at your dog, and eating the corpses you have stashed in your basement.\nA big part of writing this is to get positive feedback from other people reading it. If i don&#39;t get feedback, i kind of lack the incentive needed to continue writing. I was hoping for some big appreciation from &#39;Triad&#39; and Dancing Corpse after finishing chapter 6/7. Also, getting some feedback from the big man upstairs (Tom Ricket of course) would be cool also.\n\n-Zjack\n-- \n__________________________________________________________\r\nSign-up for your own FREE Personalized E-mail at Mail.com\r\nhttp://www.mail.com/?sr=signup\r\n\r\nSave up to $160 by signing up for NetZero Platinum Internet service.\r\nhttp://www.netzero.net/?refcd=N2P0602NEP8\r\n\n\n"}}
