It \nalso keeps the attack of resurrectioon,. but gets an alternate: \nreincarnation.  This new attack will allow the dead to come back as a \ndifferent character class and allow you to summon soliders from dead \nopponents.  Another possibility for attacks is shout curses [turn into \n stone] at opponents.\n\n\n"}}
