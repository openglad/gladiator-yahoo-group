Your choice for your GUI.\n\nHere&#39;s what it will do right off the bat:\n\n1)copy, decode, and encode grid tile information\n2)copoy, decode, and encode scenario file information (all the objects\nin a map)\n3)run the map smoother function over an entire map :)\n4)create html maps :)\n\nHere&#39;s the stuff that I plan on working on:\n\n1)polishing up my map by exception work\n2)figuring out what options to give the user for search-and-replace\nfunctionality for objects in a map\n3)creating thumbnail images using a ported-out version of the radar\nfunction\n4)*somehow, figure out appropriate conversions so I can have a\nrecaliberation function to make characters in scenarios pretty\ncomparable to the existing player(s) team.\n\n* * * *\n\nIncidently, I&#39;ve run into a snafu printing out my html maps.  It seems\nas though I can only print one page width wide and not get the entire\nmap printed out.\n\n\n"}}
