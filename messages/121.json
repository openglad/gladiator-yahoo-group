Here are these answers: My favorite character in Gauntlet is the warrior. \nMy favorite character in Gladiator is the wizard. I named mine  Raistlin \n(after the Dragon lance series). I have only one wizard because he is so \nspecial. When ever I play Dungeons & Dragons, I always have a character that \nis a mix between a wizard and a warrior.  I want it all. I want to be able to \ncarry a sword and do magic. I have never played gauntlet at the arcade. A \nfriend just showed it to me after I showed them gladiator. So I have played \nit for a couple of months. I&#39;m glad tht you joined the onelist because your \nfun to talk to! Bye!\n\n\n\n"}}
