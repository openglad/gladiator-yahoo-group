Then again, the same &#39;levels could be viruses&#39; argument could be\napplied to nearly every game/file on the internet...\n\nOf course, a VIRUS needs to be EXECUTED. If you don&#39;t &quot;run&quot; the program\n(ie: gladiator.exe) then it CANNOT infect your computer.\n\nSimple logic applies: If you recieve an executable file (.exe, .com, .bat)\nfrom someone, you should _NOT_ run it unless you know who sent it, and WHY\nthey sent it.\n\nIf I were to distribute levels via e-mail, I would most likely leave them\nUNCOMPRESSED (ie: NOT make them into that giant .exe file -- whatever it&#39;s\ncalled, i&#39;m too lazy to look. ^_^) so that people KNOW that they aren&#39;t\nexecutable.\n\nThat&#39;s my opinion.\n-Cookie\n\n\n\n\n"}}
