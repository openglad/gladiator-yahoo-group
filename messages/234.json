I am saving him \nbecause I spent hours bringing him up to his mega levels.  I will be \nsending my slightly legitimate team through soon.  Now for the review:\n\nPlotwise, it makes sense.\n\nThe forest was a bit tight fit for getting through with an archmage.\n\nHaving my teleporter marker blocked in the stairs and the labryinth \nwas a little annoying.\n\nI had to go back through twice on some levels because I missed an\nexit \ndoor (I got stuck and couldn&#39;t get to higher scenario numbers.  Of \ncourse, I missed exits on the normal levels too).\n\nHow did you get that little trick where your NPCs die and \nautomatically lose?\n\nQuality-wise:  you must have spent weeks designing the Labryinth and \nthe stairs.  Other scenarios show that you spent time designing them.\n\nHmm.  I liked your &#39;isolation&#39; level a lot and it gave me ideas on \nwhat not to do and what to do when designing such a level.\n\nOverall, it was really enjoyable and playable.  Excellent work.\n\n\n"}}
