The one level I have designed is beyond difficult or \nhard.  I challenge anybody to beat my one level with a *legitimate* \nteam right now because it can not be done.  Every new level I will \ncreate has one purpose:  to prepare a team for my Extreme Level.\n\nI am telling you upfront that I will be testing my new levels with\ntwo \n different teams:  one slightly illegit team composed of 1 archmage,\n1 \n mage, and 2 clerics.\n\nThat 100% legitimate team will be composed of the following \ncharacters: 1 elf, 2 mages (one will be converted into an archmage \nwhen it has enough experience), and 2 clerics.  I have not started my \nlegitimate team through any levels YET.\n\n\n"}}
