I could make BILLIONS of\n maps!  But why won&#39;t the scenario editor work!?  WHAT FORCES CONSPIRE\n TO KILL MY FUN!!?  I&#39;m okay.. I&#39;m okay.. *sniff*\n\nI love creating maps, too.  Especially maps that try out new ideas\nlike I did with my &quot;Weakest Link&quot; scenarios (#137 and #151).  My\nfavorite map is, of course, &quot;The Large Army&quot; (#161).  It has the\nelements I like best: one on one battles along with taking a large\nnumber of opponents at once.  Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t plot a really\ngood thread to my scenarios.\n\n\n"}}
