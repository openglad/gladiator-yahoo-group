OpenGlad 0.1 is a reference release containing 100%\nunmodified Forgotten Sages&#39; Gladiator code. It probably doesn&#39;t compile\nunder any modern compiler, but if you&#39;re brave, give the latest version of\nWatcom C++ a try(I think its at http://openwatcom.com now, but I&#39;m not\nsure if they&#39;re providing full downloads yet). However, the release\nincludes binaries, so you don&#39;t have to compile it to be able to play it.\n\nOnce again, this should be identical to the latest version of Gladiator.\nYou can download it at http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm if you\nwant to check it out. People using Winzip and the like will want to\ndownload the .zip file. The .tar.gz file is there mostly for the sake of\nSnowstorm programmers, most of whom preffer that format.\n\nAnyways, have fun. Snowstorm&#39;s next step is to get it compiling, and we&#39;ll\nsee where we go from there. Probably a bug-fix release or something. I&#39;ll\nwrite up a roadmap and post it on the project page sometime in the near\nfuture.\n\n\n- Yan\n\n\n"}}
