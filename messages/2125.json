I just thought of a brilliant idea for maps.  How about layered\nmaps?  It would work by every 10-30 seconds, one of the map tiles\nwould be &#39;pealed&#39; away and whatever map tile is in that exact spot on\nthe layer below it would appear.  This would add a new element of\nchaos and time-consciousness to playing every scenario.\n\n* * *\n\nOk, I&#39;ve been thinking a little too hard on how to create a scenario\nfull of pure chaos.  But considering how much I love\nstructure/control, that&#39;s a good thing.  The idea of anything anything\ncan happen while playing a scenario breaks down the whole barrier of\nthe game becoming boring and unpredictable after a while.\n\n\n"}}
