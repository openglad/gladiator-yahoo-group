I figured I would post even if\n&gt;I didn&#39;t own the registered game.  I know this game is awesome and I\n&gt;like it alot, but I am hesitant at paying 10 dollars(as small as the\n&gt;amount may seem) for anything whose development is halted.  Please do\n&gt;not respond and assume this is some kind of a plea for a password,\n&gt;this is just my opinoun.\n\nHiya! (Figured I&#39;d send this to the list as well)\n\nThe lack of having G:BF out there is definitely my fault -- people have \nbeen asking for it for many months, but between hard drive crashes, my \nday-job, and lots of other little things, I haven&#39;t had a chance to get it \nre-posted recently :(\n\nI do have an out-of-date version here on my hard drive -- it doesn&#39;t have \nthe fixes/features of the more recent versions, but I suppose it&#39;s better \nthan nothing.  The file is about 18 megs in size, I think -- here, I&#39;ll put \na link to it at:\n         http://24.2.87.94/GladAlpha.zip\n\nHowever, at the moment we&#39;re still not actively working on either version \nof the game (the 3.x series, or G:BF) -- that&#39;s because (as the active \npeople on this list are probably tired of hearing me say), most of the team \nmembers from FSGames are split up and working at other game companies now \n.. Mike and Doug, for example, are on the D2 team at Blizzard, currently \nworking on the D2 expansion set, etc... and I work with Sluggy Freelance \n(http://sluggy.com) all day, so we don&#39;t have much time to work on \nnon-paying projects at the moment :(\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
