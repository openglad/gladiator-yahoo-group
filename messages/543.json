Just joking.\n\nWhen I finish my current scenario I am working on, I plan on doing a \ntrue maze [I have the inspiration], which will rival &#39;The Stairs&#39; \nscenarios and &#39;The Labryinth&#39; from the tevifty in ability to get lost. \n Most of it will revolve around teleporters.  Fortunately, I will only \nuse non-mobile opponents in that scenario; unfortunately, they will \nbe invisible.  I haven&#39;t quite figured out where it belongs right now.\n\nAfter that scenario, I plan on redoing some of Ocean-going scenarios \nto make them more realistic as suggested by Telvido in a private email \nto me.  Other scenarios I do have in mind are &#39;Columnbine&#39;, &#39;Undead \nRebellion&#39;, and &#39;The Slime Master&#39;.\n\nDeep down, I don&#39;t consider any of my current scenarios a maze (&#39;Hedge \nFree At Last&#39; almost qualifies) for twoe simple reasons:  There is \nonly 1 path to take to get to the ending and there are no alternate \npaths to get lost in.\n\n\n"}}
