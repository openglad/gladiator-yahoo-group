That \nmeans I do not have an exclusive monopoly on posting code.\n\n2)It is off-limits to post programming code that modifies a saved game \nfile.  1st offense equals immediate message moderation for a period of \ntime I determine.  This is about protecting the integrity of any \nfuture tournaments for the game of gladiator.\n\nHybrid/dual class discussion will start next week.  I will break into \n3 parts, since I consider there are three basic ways to have those \nkind of characters.  Each week, we will discuss one of the ways of \ndoing that.\n\nI&#39;d like a show of hands of people who would like to have a version of \nGladiator:Beyond Freedom, but for various reasons (such as limited \ninternet access or slow internet connection) can&#39;t download it.  If \nenough people are interested, I would like to set up some sort of \ndistribution system to get copies sent out to people.\n\n\n"}}
