But any kind of programmer \nshould recognize what I am doing without having to have know Visual \nBasic: If-Then statements (there are some complex ones in there) and \nassignment statements.\n \n&gt; No comments are needed because it is really simple to understand \nwhat is going on - some conditions are checked on an object, and if \nmet that object is modified a little.\n\nYou call changing a tree into a silver bar or a door while moving its \ncoordinates a minor modification?  I am just showing an example of how \n you could use code to make wide-scale changes on an existing map.\n \n&gt; There are more elegant ways of doing it though, they just require \nmore time to create the foundation and need less time when defining \n&#39;rules&#39; -  the usual tradeoff.\n\nThere were more elegant ways, but I was looking for a simple solution. \n Except for the 1st statement [all I did was change the team number \nfor gold and silver], everything else pretty much relied on tracking \ncoordinates of an object.  Even the variable names should be fairly \nobvious.\n\nWhen I feel comfortable with deleting objects by code without \nscrewing up the scenario file, I&#39;ll do a nice write-up about how to \naccomplish that.\n\nWhen I finish that up, I&#39;ll do a nice write-up about one solution for \nadding objects by code (it&#39;ll be pretty be similiar to deleting \nobjects by code).\n\nThe biggest thing I want to remind people is DON&#39;T try to change the \nobjects in the scenario file by code and save changes to the same file \nname.  I am saving the changes I am doing by code to a different file \nname in the event I screw things up [real easy to do when resetting \nobject coordinates].\n\nI am pretty convinced someone could set up a well documented program \n[in an interpreted language] designed just to modify objects in a \nscenario file on a wide scale.\n\n\n"}}
