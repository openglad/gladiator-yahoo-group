Try making\n&gt; sure the game is in C:&#92;Glad (or something short), and run setup to make\n&gt; sure it knows the directory, and see if it&#39;s any happier.\n&gt; \n&gt; --Tom \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----\n&gt; &gt; From: alternate_dph [mailto:dph_of_rules@u...] \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 08, 2004 1:53 PM\n&gt; &gt; To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [gladiator] Re: Problem with Scen-Edit (won&#39;t save)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;But oh woe, to my utter despair, scen-edit STILL gives the same\n&gt; &gt; error!  THAT WAS WHY I LIKED GLADIATOR SO MUCH!  I like \n&gt; &gt; creating levels; you should&#39;ve seen me on ZZT.  I was limited \n&gt; &gt; by a tiny hard drive on my old  computer; I&#39;d love to use it \n&gt; &gt; on a 160GB one.  I could make BILLIONS of  maps!  But why \n&gt; &gt; won&#39;t the scenario editor work!?  WHAT FORCES CONSPIRE  TO \n&gt; &gt; KILL MY FUN!!?  I&#39;m okay.. I&#39;m okay.. *sniff*\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I love creating maps, too.  Especially maps that try out new \n&gt; &gt; ideas like I did with my &quot;Weakest Link&quot; scenarios (#137 and \n&gt; &gt; #151).  My favorite map is, of course, &quot;The Large Army&quot; \n&gt; &gt; (#161).  It has the elements I like best: one on one battles \n&gt; &gt; along with taking a large number of opponents at once.  \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t plot a really good thread to my scenarios.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
