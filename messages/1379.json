There are lots of things we would like\n&gt; to do to the game to fix known problems and add stuff.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and third, on sourceforge.net, theres a gladiator clone project, but\n&gt;  it doesnt seem to be developing at all. anyone know anything about\n&gt; it?\n&gt;\n&gt; That might be Gladiator:Beyond Freedom or might be someone trying to\n&gt; make a game off of the movie Gladiator.\n\nNo, its actually a clone of the original Gladiator game (ie, this one). It\nwas started in early april by me and a few of my friends (but then school\npicked up with SATs, APs, and finals and stuff, so it got delayed till\nnow), and I wasn&#39;t gonna announce it until we had a half-working game\n(ie, you could walk around a map). But since someone found it, I guess\nI&#39;ll blurb :-)\n\nWhat we&#39;re trying to do is create a clone or improved version of\ngladiator with advanced level editing capabilities and network play. We\nhave three programmers, a graphics guy, and an idea guy, most of whom are\nnow on vacation. Its being written in C, using SDL for graphics and later\nGTK (probably) for a level editor. It&#39;ll be made for Linux (but should\nwork on FreeBSD and other free unixes), but someone can port it to\nWinblows if they want.\n\nIf anyone wants to help, you&#39;re welcome to contact me (and to whoever\nexpressed interest before the project got put on hold, sorry about that).\nI&#39;m the project coordinator there, so I can hook you up with some tasks to\ndo or whatever.\n\nRight now the graphics engine is in its infancy, along with the server\n(for internet play). We have most of the network protocols and data\nstructures planned out, and development can skyrocket as soon as there are\nenough people with time to code.\n\nSo if you&#39;re interested, check it out at http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net\n&lt;http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net&gt; \nor http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm\n&lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm&gt; \n\n\n- Zardus (zardus@...)\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
