I don&#39;t think the game cares much \nabout\n&gt; where objects are in the list, or if there can be speed gains from \nsorting\n&gt; them a specific way (Tom?) so it should be ok.\n\nThe game does care.  It dishes your team out on the grid according to \nthe order in which the player positions are listed in the file.  With \nteleporters, it goes to the 1st teleporter laid down, 2nd teleporter \nlaid down, etc for a given teleporter number until it gets to the last \none.\n\nHaving the scenario converter around is almost as good as having a \nfull-blown scenario text editor.\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n \n\nYour use of Yahoo!
