I&#39;m all settled in at college here at RPI, across the US from\nwhere I&#39;m used to coding, and I think I can finally resume work on\nOpenglad. I&#39;ve been busy for the past month settling in and stuff so I\nhavn&#39;t coded a single (useful) line. Homework permitting, I&#39;ll be coding\na lot more now.\n\nStarting yesterday, its Sean&#39;s turn to get settled into college, so\ndevelopment will still probably still be really slow until he&#39;s all set.\nFor now I&#39;m planning on putting in scripting (and reworking charfiles)\nin Lua, maybe to the point where people can completely script character\nclasses, specials and all. The possibility is definitely there. If\nanyone has any good ideas, email me and let me know.\n\nAlso, if there&#39;s a Windows SDL guru listening, help me with fullscreen\nin windows!\n\n-- \nZardus &lt;Zardus@...&gt;\n\n\n"}}
