I&#39;ve never had a team member mind controlled, even against some \nNASTY archmages... the kind who hit you once with lightning and kill you \ninstantly. Also, I&#39;ve never had a team member killed by chain lightning, \nmostly because on the higher levels I just use a single archmage or archer \nto power my way through. I&#39;ve never known a computer-controlled archmage to \nsummon... come to think of it, I&#39;ve never seen a computer-controlled cleric \ndo anything but magic mace and that glimmering wall-thing. The main problems \nwith your suggestion are 1) regular lightning bolts, they pack a punch, and \n2) freeze time. In save-the-NPC levels, freeze time is a killer, but my \nunderstanding is that you&#39;re working on kill-em-all levels. The mages tend \nto use up a lot of their magic freezing time at the beginning, then \nbasically stop doing it. If you can keep from getting hit with lightning \nthrough that first period, you&#39;re safe. In other words, kill the ghosts as \nquickly as possible, then get to a hidey-hole and let the mages wear \nthemselves out. Also, keep your characters fast enough to outrun lightning, \nand keep the armor way up (I shoot for ten times the experience level).\n     -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\nGet more from the Web.
