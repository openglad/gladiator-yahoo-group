You can also use it to change all tiles of a particular type into \nanother type instantly. I suggest that everyone make a palette .PIX file \nwith samples of all 134 usable tiles, which you can pull up in Scen.exe for \neasy access to any map pieces you could ever need. I&#39;d simply send you mine, \nbut the Mailing List rules say no attachments. Anyway, I hope everyone can \nuse Editor successfully, as it&#39;s a powerful tool. I may use it to alter the \ncharacter images one of these days, but I have other projects to work on \nfirst. Best of luck,\n         -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n                 (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html)\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
