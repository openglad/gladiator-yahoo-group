Plus I have to do some housework and yardwork.\n\n2)This is not the only place I am visible on the &#39;net.  I am moderator \nof another yahoo group, admittedly is not very active.  I was doing an \nRP in another area.  I need to catch up on that.  In addition to that, \n I got into a writing group online - the TGS staff.  They continue off \nwhere the series &#39;Gargoyles&#39; left, except ignore almost all of the \n&#39;Gargoyles: the Goliath Chronicles&#39;.\n\n3)Pet Programming project.  Once upon a time, I started to work on a \nprogram to play &#39;Othello&#39; or &#39;Reversi&#39;.  Most of my GUI is written in \nVisual Basic and the intelligence was to be written in C.  \nUnfortunately, I discovered for that to work, I need to compile the \nintelligence as a DLL file.  Because of lack of access to such a \ncompiler, I have had to put that project on hold.  I do have plans for \nacquring that in a few months (online acquitance will buy it for me at \na reduced cost and ship it to me and I will repay him.).\n\nWith all of the above going on, I feel that if I tried taking any more \n things, I would be stretching myself a little too thin.\n\n\n"}}
