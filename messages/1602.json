I tried to find some of my\n&gt; old saved game files and import them but couldn&#39;t find them.  Got any\n&gt; suggestions?\n\nHmm.. Interesting. Its supposed to save save0 before loading any levels,\nalthough maybe its failing to do that. Try doing the following:\n\n1. Make sure there is a save/ directory in the directory where you\nput Openglad.\n2. Make sure that the directory you put openglad is the same as the one\nthat is specified by the &quot;data&quot; option in openglad.cfg\n3. If you havn&#39;t done so, try launching Openglad through an MSDOS prompt\nfrom the directory that it was installed into (ie, cd C:&#92;Openglad and then\nexecute openglad.exe)\n\nIf that still doesn&#39;t fix it, make a new team, save the game, and then\ncopy save1.gtl into save0.gtl and try it then. If even that doesn&#39;t fix\nit, http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net/save0.gtl and put it in your save/\ndir, then see if that works.\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
