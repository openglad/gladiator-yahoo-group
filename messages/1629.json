When the soldier \n outclasses opponents, I&#39;d say Whirldwind is effective.  I used \nWhirlwind once in my &quot;Slime Lords&quot;, but the strength is a joke.\n\n&gt;Charge could be altered to automatically target an opponent that&#39;s in \nfront of the soldier (perhaps in a 10-o&#39;clock-to-2-o&#39;clock range)... \nthat would increase it&#39;s usefulness.\n\nThe biggest use I&#39;ve had out of &quot;charge&quot; was using it to run away from \nan opponent or catch up to an opponent.\n\n&gt; Boomerang should definitely be altered--a limit on the number of \nboomerangs that can be thrown, and a wider range of spots at which the \nboomerang will cause damage in its flight.\n\nAlso, rework the duration of boomerangs.  They can last seemingly \nfavor.  I&#39;d like to rework the range to be confined to a relatively \nsmaller area and instead of forming a web, forming a box around the \nsoldier.\n \n&gt; Elves--what can I say. They throw too many rocks. I used to run \naround after completing a mission, shooting down all the stray rocks \nthat enemy elves had thrown that were still ricocheting around the \nmap.\n\nI do that a lot to speed things up.\n\n&gt;I&#39;d like to see a limit on the rocks an elf can throw at a time... \nonce the maximum (which would increase with level) had been reached, \nthe previously thrown rocks would disappear.\n\nI can agree to that.  Except I believe the game should take into \nconsideration the size of a map when determining the max number of \nrocks per elf.  Smaller maps = less rocks.  My &quot;The Weakest Link 2&quot; \nreally illustrates problems with seemingly too many rocks.\n\n\n"}}
