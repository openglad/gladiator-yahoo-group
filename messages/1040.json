It is common sense that you wouldn&#39;t want to kill the guards, but by saying that, that means that you&#39;re a native to Jakarta-town. \nI can&#39;t say this is really a question, because basically it&#39;s going to depend upon how the storyline advances, but if you are an assassin in Jakarta town, that leaves you three choices:\n1. You work for the Saervii. Now since the Saervii have been information gathering until now, you&#39;ve been lying dormant awaiting your first mission.\n2. You work for Jakarta. You&#39;re anti-rebellion working under Shifter (the man in white at the start of chapter 3) This makes you a bad guy that we&#39;ll probably have to kill, since you&#39;re pretty much unbribable.\n3. You&#39;re independant. [I KNOW YOU&#39;RE GOING TO WANT THIS ONE, COME ON, ADMIT IT! :D] Whether you&#39;ve been here for a few weeks, or most of your life, you dont owe allegiance to anyone, and you&#39;ve done odd jobs for the Saervii and/or Jakarta. If there was some way of influence (family member, wife, children get killed or somethin) then maybe we could get you over to the Saervii. Or you could be like Shadow from ff3 and work for money.\n\n-Zjack\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free! \r\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143 \r\n\r\n\n\n"}}
