My friend and I used to play version 1.5 \non level 11 all the time.  We would hide in the southwest corner (I was a \ndruid; he was a thief).  I would just plant trees for him to blow up and \nthen when the enemy had killed each other off... that was back when it was a \ntough level.  I dunno what happened after that version of the demo, but it \nseems much easier now.  Ah, those were the days.\n\nBack on subject, we though that was a good scenario because it took some \nwork and thinking on our part.  Unfortunately, there are some levels that \nare just too big and hard.  In the current version, there&#39;s a level with \nBlue and Green ghosts and skeletons.  It&#39;s in a cave-like place (I don&#39;t \nremember the number), but the thing that sucks about it is the inablility to \nmove for 20 minutes after being scared into a corner with 10-20 other \ncreatures.  That may be the fault of the &#39;scare&#39; function, though.  Ah well.\n\nIn all, I think bigger levels are better, and varied terrain is good.  \nLevels like 14 and 15 are nice and big, but there isn&#39;t enough variation in \nthem.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
