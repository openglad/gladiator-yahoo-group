I transformed on my own an\nOthello program in QBasic without subroutines into a very workable and\neasily expandable program.  I was working on a program to use Visual\nBasic as a GUI and C as my intelligence for Othello, but my old PC\ncouldn&#39;t support it and my copy of Visual Studio on CD has bad files\non it.  I am currently working on acquiring all of Visual Studio to\ninstall on this PC so I can complete a program I started.\n\nThe easiest way to make a new scenario mouse-oriented would be use\nVisual Basic or Visual C/C++, IMHO.\n\nI would like a show of hands of those who would like to work on a\nscenario editor.  Please include some hints of qualifications.\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
