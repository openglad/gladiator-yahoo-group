You can find it at\n&gt; http://www.vandyke.com/products/crt/index.html\n&gt;\n&gt; There is another program, designed specifically for MUD&#39;s, called ZMUD and\n&gt; it aparently has specific capabilities for use in MUD&#39;s rather than being a\n&gt; generic telnet program.\n&gt; You can find it http://www.zuggsoft.com/zmud/zmudinfo.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; - Deathifier (David Storey)\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: &lt;crayner@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;gladiator@egroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 22, 2001 6:10 AM\n&gt; Subject: [gladiator] A Roleplaying Environment\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hey hey.  There has been a lull of silence on this list, and I\n&gt; &gt; figured it was due to a real lack of development on the Gladiator\n&gt; &gt; front.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This isn&#39;t directly about Gladiator, but about a game that is similar\n&gt; &gt; to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Are any of you familiar with MUDs?  For those of you who aren&#39;t, a\n&gt; &gt; MUD is basically a game that you connect to with a 100% text\n&gt; &gt; interface and explore and communicate with other players by typing in\n&gt; &gt; commands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Given that description, many of you can see how casual and how stern\n&gt; &gt; a MUD can be about its &#39;roleplaying&#39; -- roleplaying is how you play\n&gt; &gt; your character.  If you play your character like you&#39;re talking to\n&gt; &gt; your pals on ICQ, then you are not roleplaying.  But if you play your\n&gt; &gt; character like he is really facing off with that enormous dragon in a\n&gt; &gt; fight to the death, then you are roleplaying.  Roleplaying is\n&gt; &gt; especially entertaining when there are other players roleplaying with\n&gt; &gt; you as well, a real drug for the active imagination (which I&#39;m sure\n&gt; &gt; many of us bear).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve found a MUD that, while based on a desolate planet called\n&gt; &gt; Zalanthas, has classes and a history similar to that which your\n&gt; &gt; Gladiator characters might have.  Some of the beginning classes\n&gt; &gt; include: warrior, ranger, assassin, burglar, pickpocket, and\n&gt; &gt; merchant; with subclasses (things that your characters is good at\n&gt; &gt; second) archer, forester, hunter, physician, house servent, thief,\n&gt; &gt; weaponscrafter, and even bard.  Reading those probably sparks a few\n&gt; &gt; ideas about Gladiator characters you&#39;ve played.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The roleplaying standards here are the strictest of any MUD I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; seen.  The administrators will intervene if someone around you isn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; playing their character realistically, and this sort of regulation\n&gt; &gt; makes playing a hell of a lot of fun.  You really feel like you&#39;re on\n&gt; &gt; a desolate desert planet, striving to acquire resources so you can\n&gt; &gt; survive another day or two.  Because of the inherent power of the\n&gt; &gt; magic classes, you have to play one &quot;regular&quot; character fairly well\n&gt; &gt; before you apply for a &#39;magicker.&#39;  Every character has a rich\n&gt; &gt; background and a minimum four-line description which you have to\n&gt; &gt; submit before you start playing and has to be approved by the\n&gt; &gt; administrators (which usually happens in under 24 hours).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A rich background, intelligent players, and unique races and classes\n&gt; &gt; all conform to bring forth the best roleplaying environment I&#39;ve ever\n&gt; &gt; played (sounds like an advertisement at this point, doesn&#39;t it?).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The homepage for the game is at http://www.armageddon.org/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To play, point your telnet client to www.armageddon.org port 4050\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you&#39;re using Windows and are unsure how to do this, your best bet\n&gt; &gt; is to type in telnet://www.armageddon.org:4050 from the RUN command\n&gt; &gt; in your Start Menu.  I recommend you visit the homepage first.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If anyone&#39;s still interested and would like help, feel free to email\n&gt; &gt; me ( mailto:crayner@... ) and I&#39;ll be glad to.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Take care guys.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  -Chris/Shayd\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n"}}
