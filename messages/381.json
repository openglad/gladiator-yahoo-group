I figured \n&gt;i can work on them during school on my laptop while i&#39;m not busy. \n&gt;I&#39;ve been busy at home playing EverQuest so it kinda hard for me to \n&gt;focus.  .but i have a prob determining what difficulty of scenarios i \n&gt;should build.  my last one was kinda bugged and unless someone would \n&gt;like to take a look at the scenarios i had for that to maybe fix it \n&gt;they are more then welcome, but my main problem is how hard should i \n.make the new one, i understand you all have incredibly powered groups \n&gt;(well most of you), so how can i make it difficult? i need to know \n&gt;stats on your partys or groups so i can determine the average amonut \n&gt;of difficulty possible.\n\nWell, if my memory serves me correctedly, by the time I finished the \ntevfifty all of my characters had experience levels in the tens.  Be \ncarefull because I hope I don&#39;t get my legitimate archmage too much \nexperience (he has experience level above 220) just going through the \nrest of my scenarios.\n\nI actually have a scenario with 100% invisible opponents and the one \non the path before that one has some invisible opponents.  My \nsuggestion (somewhat hypocritical) is few characters higher than \nexperience level 10 and no characters above experience level 20.  If \nyou do that, you&#39;ll be shooting slightly lower than the same range I \nam going to next.\n\nI am just now getting to the point where I feel safe using 100% \nexperience level 15s and higher.  I actually view experience level 1-5 \ncharacters as potential skeletons and ghosts.  \n\nI hope you enjoy those scenarios I sent you Tevildo.  The 1.6 billion \nscenario should prove helpfull in jump starting a team to use to play \nagainst your new scenario.  I wanted you to get an idea of what I will \nNOT publish, but will have at home.\n\n\n"}}
