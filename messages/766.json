I have also tried changing \nConventional Memory but that results in the game crashing.  Changing \nMS-DOS protected mode memory has also resulted in the game crashing.\n\nAre there any other modifications I can do to increase Gladiator&#39;s \nperformance?  I have already closed down almost all my other programs \nwhen running gladiator.\n\nBTW, after this topic, there are no new topics avaiable.\n\n\n"}}
