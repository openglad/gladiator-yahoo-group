I have already finished 5 \nnew ones.  I will start on #6 soon.  I think it oughta be a race  to \nsee who comes out with new good scenarios NEXT.  As I said before,\nthe \n ones I am working on will NOT be easy and should be considered\n&#39;HARD&#39; \nat the easiest settings.  Creating new scenarios is NOT as easy as I \npreviously thought.\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Seth Mitchell&quot; &lt;smitchell@t...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; The poll has been fixed.\n\n\n"}}
