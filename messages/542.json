In the off-chance that \nsomebody at FSGames make give us access to scenario specs.\n\nI agree it needs to be start from stratch for the most part with a \nnew editor.  It should combine features from both scen.exe and \neditor.exe .  Resizing should definitely be in the features of the \nnew scenario editor.  I had to resize &#39;The Weakest Link&#39; in much the \nsame way Telvido has had to do with his scenarios.\n\nWait a minute:  There is a feature in editor.exe to allow you to \nreplace all of one tile type to another?\n\nI think that brings up another point:  The documentation for the new \nscenario editor needs to be very complete, listing all features and \nexplaining how to access them.  Copy-and-paste feature for objects \nshould be included as well as undelete.  A nice touch would be \nallowing us to control the individual stats for NPCs and opponents \n(Example: setting the intelligence level of a mage at an extremely \nhigh level).\n\n\n"}}
