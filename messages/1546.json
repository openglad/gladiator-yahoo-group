Damn it, though, I am running into \nproblems with free memory.  I can&#39;t run more than 2 forms at a time, \nwhich isn&#39;t a problem (at least not yet).  I also streamlined lots \nof the code.  By the time I am finished, there will be very little \nfunctionality that this program won&#39;t do, besides create maps and \nassign names to characters.  As soon as I get the current level of \ndebugging and testing done, I&#39;ll be adjusting things so that you could \npick which characters could go on which teams.  After I get that \nsquared away, I&#39;m going to compile the whole program.  The biggest \nfeedback I am looking forward to is making the program more user \nfriendly.\n\nOf course, I have not checked the program to see what happens when you \n enter &quot;0&quot; in certain locations; I am trying to get all the \nfunctionality fleshed out first.\n\n\n"}}
