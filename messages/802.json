Is there a problem with just reading the file in parts,\n&gt; through a buffer, and writing it to another file?  That way it&#39;s not\n&gt; necesarry to actually load the whole file in memory, it just converts\n&gt; it.\n\nYup that will work - read, analyse and then write out for each individual\npart.\nIt was how I was initially doing it until I sat down and thought about it\nand what I could make into a reusable component for the scenario editor.\n\n&gt; Of course that won&#39;t be much good for the scenario editor, but for\n&gt; a file conversion utility it should be ok right?\n\nYep for just the converter it&#39;ll be fine.\n\n&gt; Now if I could only\n&gt; remember all the basic stuff I used to know about C programming ;ï¿½\n\nYes that&#39;d come in handy I think.\nIf you (or the other coders) need some help just let me know.\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
