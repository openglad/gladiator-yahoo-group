I heartburst them, and then they grow.\n\n2)Is there any way in heck to kill a large/medium slime with one blow? \n  No matter how powerfull your attack is, the best you can do is make \nthem shrink one size down.  I swear that if anyone could master slime \nand use one as an entire team, the team would be unbeatable because \nyou could always run your opponents out of magic.\n\n3)Slime have this knack for getting shrank one size and a second later \ngrowing back to theat original slime.  A single bomb can&#39;t do enough \ndamage to a slime, but 15 or so overlapping bombs can.\n\n4)What&#39;s with Slime and Poison Clouds?  Slime can be held in place by \nan anchored Poison Cloud, but every other character can walk right \nthrow it.\n\nSlime are most vulernable in tight spaces where you can anchor Poison \nClouds and are most dangerous in a completely open field.\n\nBTW, I should be through with creating another scenario soon, leaving \nme with 7 to complete my set of 50.  I don&#39;t want to think about the \ndesign for the next scenario.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
