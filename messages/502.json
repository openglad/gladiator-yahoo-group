With my archmage, I just summon an image, let it \ndie, and then turn it into a very threatening ghost or skeleton.\n\nI&#39;m still concerned that my newest scenario &#39;Weakest Link&#39; is too \ndifficult.  Telvido, I am probably going to send it to you as an \nattachement to evaluate for being too difficult.  Anyone else who \nwants a shot at it, email me personally (as opposed to the list) with \nthe word Gladiator&#39; somewhere in the subject line.\n\n\n"}}
