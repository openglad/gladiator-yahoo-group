The original code\n&gt; used Watcom C++ (10.0a), along with some custom assembly routines for the\n&gt; graphics and (I think) sound.  So some files will probably compile easily,\n&gt; while others will be more difficult.  I also don&#39;t remember if our original\n&gt; code was 16-bit or 32-bit, so that may also take some tweaking.\n\nI see sleepless nights ahead.. Allrighty, we&#39;ll keep all that in mind\nwhile planning our course of action from here on. I think we&#39;ll get the\nwhole thing compiling first (maybe after replacing the assembly), then go\nfrom there.\n\n&gt; Anyway, I&#39;ve zipped up everything of our source -- it&#39;s about 4.5 megs with\n&gt; all the gunk.  If need be, I can create a pared-down version of just source\n&gt; files and existing data files.  I&#39;ve also created a &quot;Tom Ricket&quot; account at\n&gt; SourceForge and posted a comment in the forums .. let me know what&#39;ll work\n&gt; best.\n\n4.5 megs is good. I replied to the comment with what would work best for\nthe OpenGlad team.\n\n&gt;\n&gt; For the licensing -- yes, it&#39;s been long enough (and we&#39;re not working on it\n&gt; anymore), that we&#39;d be happy to provide it under a standard open source /\n&gt; GPL / something-or-other license .. let me know what you need and I can get\n&gt; any standard forms listed :)\n\nAwesome. GPL would be best, as that&#39;s what we&#39;re planning on releasing the\nproject under.\n\nThanks again.\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
