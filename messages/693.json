That way, you could\n&gt; set up scenarios to limit your opponents to either 50, 250, or some\n&gt; other number.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can just imagine in one of my personal scenarios, having one\n&gt; archmage fighting off a thousand slime and gaining lots of experience.\n&gt;  Just joking or not.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
