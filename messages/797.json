While I doubt they&#39;d be terribly interesting my ISP has\nscrewed up anything but HTTP access to my site (and a few other aussie\nsites) so I can&#39;t put the screenshots up until I blast the twits tomorrow\nabout the problem.\n\nThe only other interesting situation I had was with reading in text lines -\nwhen you read in the line length of the next line make sure you check that\nit doesn&#39;t have 0 characters (which represents a blank line in the game).\nIf you are using ReadFile() from the Win32 API you&#39;ll find that if it is\nsuccessful but the number of bytes read is 0 it signals the file pointer was\npast the end of the file - so if you tell it to read 0 bytes you can produce\na false error :)\n\nAh well, I&#39;m still on track to have it done within a couple of days, the\nrest should be a lot simpler.\n\nOh, and DPH - I ran it over that 200k scenario file in your torture pack,\nand it only took a second or two to load (P3-800), we&#39;ll see how long it\ntakes to write it back out :)\nLastly, I&#39;m thinking about adding in a compare ability to the converter so\nthat you can make sure two scenarios are the same and that the conversion\nprocess works.  Any ideas if this would be useful outside the converter?\n\nEnjoy yourselves,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
