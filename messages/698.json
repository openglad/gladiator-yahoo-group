How do you suggest we test this theory?\n\n\n&gt; Something I&#39;ve noticed: one of the only other things that will slow \ndown \n&gt; Gladiator is having a whole hell of a lot of elemental fire on the \nscreen. \n&gt; But that&#39;s ONLY if the fire is on the screen where you can see it. \nOnce you \n&gt; stop sunbursting and the flames reach the edge of the visible field \n&gt; everything speeds up again. Usually this lag isn&#39;t significant, but \nit&#39;s \n&gt; noticeable.\n\nPersonally, I would never use chain-lightning if I have summoned \nelementals.  Sometimes, flames from starbursting reach the ends of the \nscenario.  Any, either I summon lots of fire elementals (I don&#39;t mean \na dozen, I mean mnore like thirty or more) or I use chain lightning.  \nSummoning fire elementals is far more efficient as far as using the \nleast amount of magic energy compared to summong chain-lightning.\n\n \n&gt; Half-classes made by merging two preexisting characters? How do you \npropose \n&gt; to make that thematic? &quot;The orc tears viciously into the druid, \ndevouring \n&gt; his flesh and gaining his skills!&quot; or &quot;After undergoing horrific \noperations, \n&gt; the Archer finally healed... his old skeleton entirely removed and \nreplaced \n&gt; with the reanimated skeleton of a dead man.&quot; or &quot;The thief \nsuccessfully \n&gt; stole the archmage&#39;s staff and cloak.&quot; I don&#39;t see how this could \nreasonably \n&gt; be introduced, but I&#39;m open to suggestions.\n\nI actually I&#39;d prefer the idea of the two characters exchanging \nabilities rather than merge to become a new character.  Accomplishing \nthis would be something like a mage saying to the characters &quot;I bid \nthee from henceforth share abilities.&quot;  120 halfings isn&#39;t quite \nright.  The total number of halfings would equal the total number of \ncharacters times the sum of the total number of characters and -1.  Of \ncourse, you wouldn&#39;t allow a character to share abilities with the \ncharacter it can be promoted to, so that limits a few more.\n\n\n"}}
