Incidently, I \nwould rather not have anybody end up with an exp level 4 character \nafter going through the tournament scenarios.  There are some definite \nways of achieving that goal.\n\nBeyond that, I would like to see the rules discussed in here.  Basic \nrules like what constites &#39;cheating&#39; and how to score points and how \nto decide tie-breakers.\n\n\n"}}
