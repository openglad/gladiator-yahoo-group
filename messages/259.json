The purpose of the \narchmage? Send off chain lightnings, heartburst, teleport into the middle of \nthe action and basically kick butt.\n\n\nI have general question:  when you finish all the scenarios that are\nshipped with the registered version of gladiator, what is the\n*lowest*\n  experience level that any member of your team has?  I need to know\nbecause of plans for the scenarios I am working on.\nSorry, but I haven&#39;t finished the original levels with my mage/archmage \ncombo yet, but I&#39;ll be sure to notify you when I do. I often buy them levels \nhowever...\n\nTata for now,\nSadie (The Gladiator Queen :-) )\n----Original Message Follows----\nFrom: &quot;dph of rules &quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\nReply-To: gladiator@egroups.com\nTo: gladiator@egroups.com\nSubject: [gladiator] egroup contributions\nDate: Fri, 22 Sep 2000 22:18:12 -0000\n\nI have noticed that of all the people subscribing to this egroup,\nonly\n  a handfull actually post messages.
