The only thing I know about the next series \nis \n&gt; more of the Orcian Empire. Maybe you can help.\n\nOne comment: The lowest experience level of my own 100% legitimate \nteam is experience level 94. It has been through all the built-in \nscenarios, the tevfifty and my own set.  I am concerned about crashing \nthe game because of acquiring too much experience for a single player.\n\nOne Question: What scenarios should a player have completed before \ngoing into the Unix series into order to avoid problems handling the \nopponents?\n\n\n"}}
