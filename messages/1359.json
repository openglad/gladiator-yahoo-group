(see comments about crashing the game with a soldier \nwho hadn&#39;t reached experience level 300)\n\nI prefer to think when you acquire a certain amount of experience \n(forced if you exceed a max value), you should have a new option of an \nupgrade for your character to a status of &quot;minor god&quot; [I need to leave \nroom for a higher status after this point].  At that, your mgl (minor \ngod level) would become the log (base 10) of your total amount of \nexperience points minus 7, rounded to the hundredths digit.  Along \nwith this mgl setting, there would be some perks: access to your mgl&#39;s \nvalue of seconds of use of all potions and increased values for health \nand mana.  There would also be a significant disadvantage: in order to \nincrease mgl value, the log (base 10) of your experience during any \nscenario minus 7 would have to be greater than 0 for that value to be \nadded to your mgl value.  For those of you confused, a character with \nan mgl value of 2 would have 10 times as much experience as a \ncharacter with an mgl value of 1 (the mgl value is about magnitude of \nexperience).  \n\nThis would prevent game crashes due to too much experience and make it \n very tough to climb up on the mgl ladder.\n\nOn the other hand, the game could simply have a limit (around 1023) on \nthe level numbers for characters and generators in the game.  That \nwould effectively make it impossible to acquire too much experience.\n\n\n"}}
