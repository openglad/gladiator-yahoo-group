The second\n&gt; &gt; one is four players, fullscreen at 1024x768.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It may look like regular old Openglad/Gladiator but\n&gt; &gt; a lot of the code\n&gt; &gt; has been completely rewritten. Makes things a whole\n&gt; &gt; lot easier to work\n&gt; &gt; with. I cringe everytime I look through the original\n&gt; &gt; Openglad code\n&gt; &gt; since it is a mess. After all, it was pretty much\n&gt; &gt; just a port of\n&gt; &gt; Gladiator. We didn&#39;t try to make it clean, or alter\n&gt; &gt; the code structure\n&gt; &gt; so it inherited much of Gladiator&#39;s messiness. I am\n&gt; &gt; not dissing the FS\n&gt; &gt; guys (sorry Tom :), they did an amazing job\n&gt; &gt; considering they were\n&gt; &gt; working with DOS, but I doubt they thought other\n&gt; &gt; people would be going\n&gt; &gt; through their code years later. :P\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am going back to UCSB tomorrow, but my class\n&gt; &gt; schedule is a lot less\n&gt; &gt; demanding than last quarter so I am planning on\n&gt; &gt; getting a lot done in\n&gt; &gt; the next couple weeks with Openglad-e.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \t\t\n&gt; __________________________________ \n&gt; Do you Yahoo!? \n&gt; Yahoo!
