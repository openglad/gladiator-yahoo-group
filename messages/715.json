(that&#39;s the othe\nthing i&#39;m working on, coding-wise.. nothing fancy, just the basic &quot;when do\nwe talk here&quot; and &quot;who said how many lines&quot; functions will do, for now.\nLinking nicks is *PAINFUL*)\n\n\nHehe, no actually it converts web site log files (CLF format).  I finally\nmoved my domain a couple of months ago to a much better host but the only\nproblem was while it produced more info (mainly referrer info) in the log\nfiles, they were not in the &#39;standard&#39; format, and so the analyser\n(webalizer) I use couldn&#39;t process them.\nSo I just wrote a program to take the input file, convert each line and\nproduce an output file.\nSince I&#39;d never done much file I/O before it was quite a learning\nexperience, but it does work now, and I now have this big pile of info for\nmy website to improve it :)\n\n&gt; &gt;Oh, how are the other programmers going with the editor task?\n&gt;\n&gt; Got the header information to load correctly, and added some testing\nfunctions to ensure that the grid file you load *IS* a gridfile, and that\ngridfile is a v7 or v8 gridfile... (tho i think i might be able to figure\nout the differences of earlier versions too)\n&gt;\n&gt; Right now, almost everything is in main() with limited useage of\nfunctions... mainly because I was coding off the top of my head for most of\nthe header. It&#39;ll all be separated out into proper functions eventually.\nhaven&#39;t touched it in a week.. and then i go away on vacation on the 3rd..\nso it&#39;ll probably have to wait until the 11th, when i return. i&#39;ll have some\nnet access but no compiler access during that time.\n&gt;\n&gt; linked list for the objects looks to be the easiest way to handle them,\njust FYI.. though on some of those maps, there&#39;s like a billion objects! :/\n\nHehe, yeah I hadn&#39;t thought much about data structures, but a linked list\nsounds the best (or maybe a queue, though a queue wouldn&#39;t be any good for\nthe full editor, just for conversion).\n\nAlso DPH - the objects on top of each other won&#39;t matter, as each individual\none has it&#39;s own X,Y location, so we just read it, store it, and write it\nout again, as long as we put the objects back in the same order we took them\nout the game should load the file the same :)\n\nWell I&#39;m off to work on it, once I get something usable going I&#39;ll put it on\nmy website for people to play with.\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
