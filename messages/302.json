Gladiator 3.X is written using the Watcom C++ \ncompiler (10.0a); GBF is written using Microsoft Visual C++ (Win32 code).\n\n&gt;Say I just used the editor and used an illegal color. If I delete that\n&gt;image, will my scen.exe get restored???\n\nYep, it should, if I understand the question correctly.\n\n&gt;My own worst opponent in fighting gladiator is a faerie.  For pete&#39;s\n&gt;sake, those faeries freeze mages and archmages (my favorite\n&gt;characters) longer than anything else.  Yep, they freeze a fire\n&gt;elemental and clerics for less time with the same hit.  Why?\n\nI believe we made the freeze duration partially dependent on the target&#39;s \nconstitution -- thus, mages and archmages will tend to stay frozen longer, \nall else being equal.\n\n&gt;That brings me to an interesting question:  Is there anything in the\n&gt;game that would keep a team of 1 from being frozen in place\n&gt;INDEFINITELY?  I mean a character could be surrounded by faeries and\n&gt;continiously fired upon and never have a chance to respond because of\n&gt;the damn faeries.\n\nThat&#39;s one of few things that tends to discourage the &quot;run through the game \nwith one super character&quot; method of play :)\n\n&gt;Sounds cool! What exactly CAN the editor do? All I did was make a guy called\n&gt;&quot;punkyguy&quot; (and now the scenario editor won&#39;t work)...\n\nThe simple answer is that Editor was designed to edit the simple graphics \nfiles (The PIX files) in the game. Initially, we also used it to design the \nlevels, doing exactly what people have said: setting to a specific &quot;color&quot; \nto represent a tile, and then drawing a level .. once we had a chance, we \ndeveloped scen.exe to make creating levels easier.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
