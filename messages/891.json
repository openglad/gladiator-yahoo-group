I&#39;d \nhate to be stuck continously waiting for another character to move \nbefore I could go any further.  What about fire elementals?\n \n&gt; the time freeze thing is MEANT to be a challenge. some teams won&#39;t \nbe \n&gt; able to defeat the mages, it appears, i suggest changing up your \nteam \n&gt; or something.\n\nMy legitimate team could defeat any scenario because the mage on the \nteam has more than enough experience to freeze time, but that isn&#39;t a \nfun way to beat scenarios.\n\n&gt; like i said before, i playtested all my scenarios with a soldier \n&gt; taken through the legitimate levels.\n\nPlease specify what you mean by &quot;the legitimate levels&quot;.  Do you mean \nall the built-in scenarios, the tevfifty, and the completed part of my \nset?\n\n\n"}}
