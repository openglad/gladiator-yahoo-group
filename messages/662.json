Maybe we could \nborrow \n&gt; ideas from there? Perhaps a high level druid could, instead of \nsummoning \n&gt; forest creatures, polymorph into them himself. Also, another spell \nworthy of \n&gt; a druid would be chain lightning. Everyone knows druids are in close \ncontact \n&gt; with nature, and how does nature demonstarte her destructivness more \nthan \n&gt; lightning? Unless someone wants to program a tornado.\n\nArchmages have chain-lightning and it is so badly coded that it isn&#39;t \nfunny.  Chain lightning will basically slow down any computer (trust \nme, I&#39;ve tried it with 1 ghz and 128 meg of RAM) to a halt if you use \nit against more than 15-20 opponents.\n\n\n"}}
