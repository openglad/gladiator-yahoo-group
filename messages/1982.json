Just one error message keeps me from compiling it.   #include \n&lt;sys&#92;resource.h&gt; gives me an error message about not being able to find resource.h.  An online friend told me, yes, that file is \nnecessary to the gen-maze program working.  I&#39;m going to try again tomorrow to see if I can get that program to compile under a \ndifferent program other than MS VC++.  \n\nIf I can get it to compile and run successfully, it should be easy enough to make the output of the program a gladiator map.  Given \nthat I do have a working smoother program on my hd, I can easily fix the tiles until I transfer the smoother application into the maze \ngenerator.\n\nZardus - I was actually thinking that if we get the random maze generator working and we can get decent intelligence for placing \ncharacters on a map, we could set a certain scenario number to take to freshly created scenario map with characters randomly \nplaced (figuring out how strong to make the opponents based on your existing saved game team) and let that be a scenario number \nthat can be repeatedly indefinitely because it&#39;s never the same map and the opponents would always be matched against the strength \nof your team.\n\n\n"}}
