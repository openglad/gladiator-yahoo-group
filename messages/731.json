I propose defining it \nas the most points, since that does not count experience gained by a \ncleric healing other teammates.  IMHO, the 1st tie-breaker should be \nadvancing the team WITHOUT clerics, since that team obviously had a \nharder time.  Some possible tie-breaker factors would be teams without \nghosts, skeletons, elves, or mages.  That one is about teams having a \nharder time getting to gold, silver, or opponents.\n\n\n"}}
