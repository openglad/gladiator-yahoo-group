In the meantime, I agree with Jeff that it (the &quot;manor&quot; levels)\nshould be around level 30.. kinda sad that I can&#39;t remember the level number,\nisn&#39;t it?\n\n--Tom\n\n \n\n---------------------------- \nTom Ricket \n&lt;mailto:tricket@...&gt;mailto:tricket@... \nForgotten Sages Games \n&lt;http://www.fsgames.com&gt;http://www.fsgames.com \n---------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n"}}
