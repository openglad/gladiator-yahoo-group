I don&#39;t want to give too much away, but\n&gt; I took the three guys I see most on the forum and used\n&gt; your names for characters in the book. I hope I dont\n&gt; disapoint anybody.\nI like it, well written, cohesive and just well done all round, and I like\nthe way you make the characters from the forum come to life :)\n\n&gt; I mention Tom Ricket in there too. He should be happy,\n&gt; because he&#39;s obtained God status!\nHehe, he should be proud :)\n\n&gt; And a late apology to Deathifier, who I saw post\n&gt; yesterday, but isn&#39;t in the story yet.\nI sneak around the forums, doesn&#39;t worry me if you can&#39;t fit me in, although\nyou did mention your group wanting a cleric :)\n\n&gt; Check it out and post feedback to me, or through the\n&gt; forum. Thanks.\nIt&#39;s good :)\nCan&#39;t wait to see more of it.\n\nVery interesting legal notice-type thing at the end, haven&#39;t seen one of\nthose attached to a short story before.\n\nCya,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
