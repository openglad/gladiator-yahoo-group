Hey, it used to look like a dog. [Admittedly,\n&gt; I still gotta do \n&gt; lots of work, but I&#39;m open for suggestions.  Yea, I\n&gt; know it&#39;s a really \n&gt; rough screen capture.]\n\nThe problem is with the head and the body. The head\nneeds to be elongated, to be more horse-like, and the\nbody needs to be about twice as thick. You should\nprobably also draw an outline of an actual horse so\nthat you can compare your drawing to the minimap.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybody is interested, I&#39;m looking for a little\n&gt; help getting \n&gt; started with some follow-up scenarios to my last\n&gt; set.  The main thing \n&gt; I am looking for is establishing the plot lines. \n&gt; I&#39;ve run into a \n&gt; little knack because I need at least 2 paths to\n&gt; follow at a point and \n&gt; I have only 1.\n\nWell, go do research on the actual Greek mythology of\nthe Trojan War. That should give you *plenty* of ideas.\n\n__________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nThe New Yahoo! Search - Faster. Easier. Bingo.\nhttp://search.yahoo.com\n\n"}}
