I have also tried changing\nConventional Memory but that results in the game crashing.  Changing\nMS-DOS protected mode memory has also resulted in the game crashing.\n\nAre there any other modifications I can do to increase Gladiator&#39;s\nperformance?  I have already closed down almost all my other programs\nwhen running gladiator.\n\nBTW, after this topic, there are no new topics avaiable.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
