The only thing is the druids block the path of faeries when I\nuse a thief to taunt them.  I haven&#39;t tried using a soldier or an\narcher to beat the scenario I am playing around with.  What I am\ntrying to produce is a way for non-Archmages and non-Thieves to gain\nlots of experience.  I use slimes to give Archmages lots of experience\nand I use tents to give thieves lots of experience.\n\nHere&#39;s another thought: what if we could, when creating a scenario,\nspecify what abilities opponents could and could not use.  That way I\ncould put a high level mage around, but take away the ability to\nfreeze time.  Or put a high-level archmage around, and prevent him\nfrom accessing chain-lightning.\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
