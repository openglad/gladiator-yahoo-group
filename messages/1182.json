Only 1 problem I have is its \ncomposition: 1 mage, 1 archmage, and 2 clerics.  Admittedly, I will be \ncurious as heck to find out what final stats on that team will be \nafter I send through the rest of my scenarios.  I do give you some \ngood news: the last two scenarios aren&#39;t . . that difficult.  I know a \n100% legitimate team can beat those two.\n\nNo, I don&#39;t want to do a follow-up to those scenarios nor do I want \nanyone else to do a follow-up.  I am concerned about crashing the game \nif anyone did a proper follow-up [opponents would have to be at least \nexp level 20-25 to equal how I brought most characters].  Until the \ngame gets modified a lot to handle really high stats,  we shouldn&#39;t \nhave legitimate teams composed of characters who are at experience \nlevel 100+.\n\n\n"}}
