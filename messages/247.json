It&#39;s a silly question, but i \nalways\n&gt; look toward the future.  Plus it can help me with my lvs\n&gt; \n&gt;                                                         Ricky Der, \nThe\n&gt; Legendary Light\nHmm.  I beg to differ about reaching maximums.  It took me 3 or 4 \nhours to raise the money to buy a certain mage.  That certain mage\nwas \nconverted into an archmage.  That archmage was able to defeat my \nextreme level.  But, the point is to buy the next level of experience \nwould take me 30+ minutes to raise the funds.\n\nIt will be nearly impossible (IMHO) to create enough  legitimate \nepisodes to reach the maximum amount of experience.  I estimate that \none would need at least 1,000 scenarios, to approach the  experience \nlevel of my illegitimate archmage.  His experience level is beyond \n300.  But the rest of his characeristics are beyond 1000.  It cost \nroughly $250,000,000+ for him.\n\nWell, I am on this subject of super levels.  Does anyone have a 100% \nlegitimate team that has not been through either the tevfifty or Tryx \nchronicles?  I would like someone to verify the levels I am creating \nare not too hard if one went straight from the original gladiator \nscenarios into the ones I am creating.  Unfortunately, my only 100% \nlegitimate team has crossed through any scenarios yet.  I am still \nworking on my 1st easier one, but it will take time to play through \nit.\n\n\n"}}
