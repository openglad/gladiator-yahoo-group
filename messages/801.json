I should  have some time to work on\nit tomorrow.  Is there a problem with just reading the file in parts,\nthrough a buffer, and writing it to another file?  That way it&#39;s not\nnecesarry to actually load the whole file in memory, it just converts\nit.  Of course that won&#39;t be much good for the scenario editor, but for\na file conversion utility it should be ok right?  Now if I could only\nremember all the basic stuff I used to know about C programming ;�\n\nDeathifier wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Just want to let everyone that isn&#39;t yet bored with programming stuff that I\n&gt; finished off debugging the scenario file loading function and it now appears\n&gt; to be functioning properly :)\n&gt; \n&gt; For the other coders the only real trouble I had was getting the linked list\n&gt; to function properly and then setting up the variables properly - remember\n&gt; to NULL terminate any strings you have, even ones that shouldn&#39;t need it\n&gt; (like the reserved data portion, although you could also ignore it) - I had\n&gt; a rather interesting multi-hour session working out exactly what was causing\n&gt; the problem, being told that the crash was occuring somewhere inside a small\n&gt; block stack something was not helpful, and that it only affected 1 in every\n&gt; 50 to 100 objects was also not so helpful.\n&gt; *Run program, hit breakpoint just before crash, analyse next object, it\n&gt; looks fine, just like any other object, press continue and crash*\n&gt; \n&gt; I took a couple of screenshots - one of the pile of code I stuck in to help\n&gt; find the bug (turned a 1 line function into a 10 line function) and one of\n&gt; the interface.  While I doubt they&#39;d be terribly interesting my ISP has\n&gt; screwed up anything but HTTP access to my site (and a few other aussie\n&gt; sites) so I can&#39;t put the screenshots up until I blast the twits tomorrow\n&gt; about the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only other interesting situation I had was with reading in text lines -\n&gt; when you read in the line length of the next line make sure you check that\n&gt; it doesn&#39;t have 0 characters (which represents a blank line in the game).\n&gt; If you are using ReadFile() from the Win32 API you&#39;ll find that if it is\n&gt; successful but the number of bytes read is 0 it signals the file pointer was\n&gt; past the end of the file - so if you tell it to read 0 bytes you can produce\n&gt; a false error :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Ah well, I&#39;m still on track to have it done within a couple of days, the\n&gt; rest should be a lot simpler.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oh, and DPH - I ran it over that 200k scenario file in your torture pack,\n&gt; and it only took a second or two to load (P3-800), we&#39;ll see how long it\n&gt; takes to write it back out :)\n&gt; Lastly, I&#39;m thinking about adding in a compare ability to the converter so\n&gt; that you can make sure two scenarios are the same and that the conversion\n&gt; process works.  Any ideas if this would be useful outside the converter?\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy yourselves,\n&gt; Deathifier\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
