Borland C++ BUILDER I just\ndownloaded off the borland site, and DJGPP is what I learned with and\nused a couple years ago when I used to do more coding, and wrote a\ncouple of fairly simple games.  I never did get the windows port of that\nworking though, all dos stuff, but I assume this has improved since\nthen.  The one advantage of DGJPP that I can see is if someone wanted to\nport it to linux ever it would probably be fairly trivial since most\nlinux distributions use the GNU C compiler for the default (DJGPP is the\ndos port of the GNG C compiler). \n\n\n&gt; I&#39;m not a pro coder... i&#39;m not even really a hobbyist anymore.. but I&#39;ve got some knowledge that may prove useful.\n\nheh,  basically same here.  I&#39;de sure enjoy working on something though,\nhaven&#39;t had anything to code in a long time, and none of my friends know\nanything about it. \n \n&gt; I e-mailed DPH privately, thinking he was gonna be lead programmer.. Obviously, this is no longer the case. \n\nUh,  anyone wanna volenteer to co-ordinate things?  Once things get\ngoing we should probably start a new mailing list so we don&#39;t drive\npeople insane on this one if they aren&#39;t interested.\n\n&gt; ... so, anyone ever coded a group project before? (and, should this be opensource or closed source?)\n\nI vote open source.  closest thing to a group project I&#39;ve done are\nwebpages ( cause like I said, my friends don&#39;t know much about coding)\n\n\nOh yea,  and thanks Tom for all the info; it should simplify things a\nlot.\n\n\nBj�rn\n\n"}}
