Let \nthe team nearly die and then use a cleric to rebuild the health.  \nRepeat process until cleric is at desired experience level.\n\nBefore I used the registered version, I used to be able to use a druid \n to grow a tree and have a thief blow it up to get experience points. \n Why doesn&#39;t that trick work on the registered version?  Seriously, \nI&#39;ve created bombs powerfull enough to wipe out opponents, but they \nhave no effect on druid-planted trees.  WHy?\n\nAny other tricks out there?\n\n\n"}}
