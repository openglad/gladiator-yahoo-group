All of the original FSGames team\n&gt; &gt; is tied up 150% with Blizzard stuff, so we haven&#39;t had time to work on\n&gt; &gt; Gladiator in quite a while ... so anything we can get you to help with\n&gt; &gt; code, we&#39;d be happy to supply.\n\nThat&#39;s very generous of you Tom!\n\n&gt; We havn&#39;t thought of a name, but OpenGlad is a good idea :-).\n&gt;\n&gt; We&#39;d love to have access to the source, yes. Can it be provided under an\n&gt; open source license? Instead of making a clone from scratch, we could then\n&gt; port it to SDL (or some other cross-platform graphics library) and improve\n&gt; it from there.\n\nHehe, porting sounds like a big ball of fun :)\n\n&gt; The same goes for anyone else interested to help. I think we&#39;ll get alot\n&gt; more done if we&#39;re all working on one project instead of 2 or 3 different\n&gt; ones.\n\nI believe the only other project was an improved editor, which complements\nany new version anyway.\nAn actual clone was discussed, and I think DPH pretty much summed up the\ndecisions made on what we want to change in his post :)\n\nI&#39;d love to help out as well, however I&#39;ve got this thing called uni\nhounding me for the rest of the year and I&#39;m also supposed to be leading\ndevelopment on an EFS clone - a game somewhat larger than this one :/\n\nI will keep an eye on what you get up to though, and if you need help\ntracking down bugs just pop an e-mail my way - squishing bugs is one of the\nbest things I do ;)\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
