Plotwise, the presence of runes (aka towers) was making him\n&gt; weak.  Anyways, you really should defeat every scenario to go to the\n&gt; next one. Maybe have the grunts of the 2 armies fight each other\nwith\n&gt; a weak sub-commander would help.\n\n*frowns*, but making everyone beatable would ruin the current plot. \nIt wouldn&#39;t be hard to make everyone beatable, but on Nylwin Town you\ncan leave the level at any time (even without beating every enemy);\nI&#39;d like my level to be like that.  I used deathifier&#39;s GladScenConv\nprogram (great prog BTW) and saw entries like &quot;Scenario Type: 0 (Kill\nall Monsters)&quot; and &quot;Scenario Type: 2 (Must kill generators)&quot;.  What&#39;s\nthe line of code to use to make it &quot;leavable anytime&quot; so I can use\nGladScenConv (again really nice prog thanks deathifier) for\nconverstion purposes?\n\n\n"}}
