X_x) however, i was just wondering...\n&gt;\n&gt;uhm...\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;What happened to fsgames.com&quot;?? :P\n&gt;\n&gt;I can&#39;t get to the site anymore, nor have I been able to for a while. Tom?\n&gt;:( Did you shut down? Didja move? Wanna enlighten us poor souls out here? :(\n&gt;-Cookie\n\nSorry for the confusion, guys -- we had a problem with our DNS \n(domain-name-servers) which caused the &quot;fsgames.com&quot; site to vanish for \nabout two days. This affected both our web pages, and e-mail to us (ie, the \ntricket@... address wouldn&#39;t go through).  Hopefully, it&#39;s all \nfixed now :)\n\n--Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
