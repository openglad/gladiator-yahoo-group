Like Field Marshal below:\nnormal attack&#39;s like solder\n\n(every one has a reverse that reseases men or you just need to press &quot;yo&quot; to \nresease them, it doesn&#39;t matter to me)\nattack 1 call aid: like &quot;YO&quot; only much more affectave: calls everyone who \ncan get to you and isn&#39;t otherwise engaged to all attack the person you&#39;re \nattacking, they continue attacking people with you depending on how much \nmagic you used\n\nattack 2 block: create&#39;s a block formation which act&#39;s as one unit in moving \nect and only break&#39;s up if it attack&#39;s in hand to hand attack as everyone \nrushes on the enemy. when using special&#39;s cycles through all level 1 \nspecial&#39;s  of everyone in the groop using cycling button\n(no level 4+ special&#39;s cuz those would complicate things too much) and \neveryone in the the groop who has that special would use it. the reverce \nwould be for everyone who doesn&#39;t need permision to use there special&#39;s \nsimultaniously.\nattack 3 pincer: like block only when they attack in hand it hand the devide \nup into 3 groups (2 fast groops one slow one) and come at the enemy from all \nsides.\nattack 4 formations: go into your choice of 3 formations: arrow head,\ndefensive, scattered (or something)\n\nhe might need to be a bit weeker then a solder to gain more levels\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n\nFrom: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@...&gt;\nReply-To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nTo: gladiator@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 4\nDate: Mon, 02 Jul 2001 17:23:51 -0000\n\n--- In gladiator@y..., &quot;dancing corpse&quot; &lt;dancing_corpse@h...&gt; wrote:\n &gt; we didn&#39;t get much talking in this subgect...\n\nI kept waiting for this topic to be picked up and replied to.  Since\nno person bothered to reply to it, I moved on.\n\nI was hoping for a rather large (and long) amount of discussion about\nfeatures for Gladiator:Beyond Freedom.  You have to realize there is\nonly so much you can do in Gladiator the way it is currently coded.\n\nThings like speeding up chain-lightning (as indicated by Tom Ricket)\nwould require changing a lot of things.  Adding formation control to\nyour team is another because the game would have to be changed from\nthe inside to make it better suited for that type of thing.  Things\nlike adding new characters and adding (most) new attacks won&#39;t require\nsignificantly changing the code.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
