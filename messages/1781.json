Also, it should be understood after you submit\na scenario for the contest, I plan on putting all the entries into a\nsingle zip file so that the entries can be distributed more easily.\nDon&#39;t worry: the zip file will list credits for the designer of each\nscenarios.\n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nThe new MSN 8: smart spam protection and 2 months FREE*\nhttp://join.msn.com/?page=features/junkmail\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
