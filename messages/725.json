This one is only for reference.  After that, every time a \nperson completes 5 scenarios, send your saved game in to the judges.  \n\nCheating -  To prevent cheating, once all the players have completed a \nset of 5 scenarios, the judges will post all the stats of each \nplayer&#39;s team.  If anyone thinks a player is cheating, that person can \npost a message challenging the person&#39;s stats.  One or more judges \nwill go through the scenarios to check out the claim.   if at any time \na person is found to be cheating, that person will be immediately \nexpelled from the tournament.\n\nI have an optional rule mainly designed to help make it easier for the \njudges to check out cheaters:  \n\nBy the time a player has completed the 1st five scenarios, all the \nmembers of his/her team must be hired.  In return, all scenarios will \nbe pre-checked to sure that no player will be so overwhelmed with a \nscenario that he/she will need to buy extra characters to help defeat \none scenario.\n\n\n"}}
