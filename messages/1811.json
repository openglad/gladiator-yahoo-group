Its been more and more of an \nissue lately as I take my one-man thief team through the levels during \nlunch breaks at work :-)\n\nThe amount of mana put into an archmage&#39;s basic attack depends on how \nmuch available mana it has.  It&#39;s a very strong weakness because if an \nopponent has multiple spells of protection around it, you&#39;ll waste \nyour mana removing those spells of protection.\n\nI&#39;d like to add another one: My cleric raises skeletons of inconsisent \nexperience levels, even when the source is exact same (both level \nnumber and team number).\n\n\n"}}
