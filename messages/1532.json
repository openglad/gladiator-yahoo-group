We can always rewrite it in C later for use \nacross platforms. It looks good, though. The outside isn&#39;t really \nimportant, its the inside that matters.\n\nI know.  I&#39;m not that familiar with putting together a GUI in C.\n \n&gt; Terrain generation can also be incorporated into that later, but I \nthink most of us preffer coding in C than in VB. We&#39;ll get to that \nlater, though.\n\nnp.\n\n&gt; That works. Speaking of grids, I wrote a pixedit program yesterday. \nIt doesn&#39;t actually edit pixes yet, but it views them. Its pixedit.c \nin the utils/ folder if you want to check it out. Latest in CVS works \nquite well.  This will also work for map grid files.\n\nHmm.  I am going to check that out.  I&#39;m going to have read the specs \nfor how the grid file is put together to determine range for \nlocations.\n\n&gt; I think the best thing would be to have an option for the amount of \nenemy teams, then distribute foes randomly between them.\n\nHmm, I&#39;ll listen for more opinions.  I&#39;m pretty inclined to let the \nuser choose the amount of characters on each team.\n \n&gt; If start-up positions arn&#39;t specified, the game will scatter your \nteam all over the map randomly. If exits arn&#39;t specified, the only way \nto get out of the level is to abort.\n\nI&#39;ll probably put a generic exit going back to level 1, as a \nplaceholder, until I work on a better solution (adjusting my gui to \nallow the user to choose exits)\n\n&gt; Those are all reasonable assumptions and are easy to change in code.\n\nI would like one BIG request for the next version: Do something about \nhow the text for each story is displayed.\n\n&gt; Cool. Do you want me to create a subproject for it on Sourceforge so \nthat it&#39;ll be easily accessable from the sourceforge project page? \nThat would also take care of hosting and all that stuff.\n\nWell, I planned on sending you a zip file containing all my work once \nI am finished so others can improve on it.\n\n\n"}}
