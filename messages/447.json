That is the same speed setting I used for my 100 mhz\n&gt;computer.  Any comments about that from the gladiator programmers?\n\nThe speed settings work on a time interval basis, and should be independent \nof the clock speed .. of course, what that means is that you can go from a \n9 that&#39;s playable to a 10 that suddenly becomes a blur, because you shift \nfrom some small, but set, amount of time, to &quot;go as fast as you can&quot; :)\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
