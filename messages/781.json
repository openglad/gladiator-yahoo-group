So, \ninstead of ruling out a class, we just balance it. The main problem I&#39;ve \nheard is slimes, so this is what I think should be done. Some thing like \n&quot;Due to the magical nature of the halfling, split can be dangerous.&quot; or \nsomething like that. These are the numbers I think we should use in the \nbackground(that the player won&#39;t know about of course)\n\n20% chance of the halfling be out right destroyed.\n\n20% chace of the halfling being seperated in the split, and each return to \ntheir respective class, but at half the original level.\n\n20% chance the split is succesful but the resulting charcters are level 1\n\n40% chance of success\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
