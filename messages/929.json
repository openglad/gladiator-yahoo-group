I was giving them names, so I could tell them \napart (That&#39;s a hint: there are more teleporters in this scenario than \nany other I have created).  I decided, for fun, to try out the \nscenario converter on the file and I learned something: The last \nobject to be placed on the map is the first object listed in the file \nunless the converter flip-flops the order.  To get the teleporters to \nwork in the order I wanted them to go, I had to place themn in reverse \norder, but the map file shows them in the correct order.\n\nThat brings me to another feature for the new scenario editor: ability \nto take a set of teleporters and change the order in which they would \nwork.\n\n\n"}}
