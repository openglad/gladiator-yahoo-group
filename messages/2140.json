Keeping them alive isn&#39;t a problem (unless\n&gt; I&#39;m too slow), I&#39;ve made one of the enemy groups very strong.  Too\n&gt; strong for you to beat.  This was on purpose; the stronger force is\n&gt; trying to subdue a slave uprising, and you&#39;re caught in the middle.  I\n&gt; wanted to be able to beat the level without having to defeat the enemy\n&gt; (which is too powerful for you.. for now).  The thing is.. when I set\n&gt; the &quot;Can Always Exit&quot; option to Yes, it won&#39;t let me leave until every\n&gt; enemy is destroyed, precisely what I *don&#39;t* want to have to do!  I\n&gt; know it&#39;s possible because Nylwin City doesn&#39;t require you to kill\n&gt; everyone to proceed to the next level.  I could just make the enemy\n&gt; less powerful, but that would ruin my current story plot!  What am I\n&gt; doing wrong?\n\nEasy, in one of my scenarios, where you rescue the God of the Undead,\nhe is much weaker in his 1st appearance than in his next appearance. \nWhy?  Plotwise, the presence of runes (aka towers) was making him\nweak.  Anyways, you really should defeat every scenario to go to the\nnext one. Maybe have the grunts of the 2 armies fight each other with\na weak sub-commander would help.\n\n\n"}}
