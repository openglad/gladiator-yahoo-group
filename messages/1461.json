Missed last week&#39;s topic. Oh well :-(\n\nI was gonna be gone all week, but turns out I have minimal email. Might as\nwell reply:\n&gt; I was hoping somebody would mention triggers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, if we had triggers, I&#39;d redo my &quot;Tunneled Labyrinth&quot; to make a\n&gt; trigger where as soon as the last opponent was killed, all the walls\n&gt; would come down.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, if we had triggers, I&#39;d redo my &quot;Castle Defenses&quot; to make a\n&gt; trigger where once the 4 towers were destroyed, the NPC would increase\n&gt; its experience level.\n\nTriggers (simple ones) might not be too hard to implement.. I&#39;ll look into\nit when the port is finished. There&#39;s already a &quot;NPC Must Survive&quot; option,\nso that&#39;s some sort of minimal trigger. Might be interesting to expand on\nthat.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, if we had triggers and a 3-d map, I would make all my ocean\n&gt; going scenarios one map where you have to do things in order.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, I have an even better than idea than triggers: Handicapped\n&gt; Scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt; That would be a scenario where from 1 to 4 different magical attacks\n&gt; are disabled.\n&gt;\n&gt; One combo of 4 that I would like to have disabled is freeze time,\n&gt; chain-lightning, mind control, and charm opponent for certain\n&gt; scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another combo of attacks I would like to disable for certain scenarios\n&gt; is teleport and tunnel.\n\nHow special abilities are implemented right now, that shouldn&#39;t be too\nhard to do either. Just a matter of adding more stuff to scen files and\nadding checks in that 1.5k-line function for special attacks.\n\nOther things that might make scenarios better:\n\nIn-game level-ups (this can kinda go under triggers). For example, if you\nhave an arena map that can be played for a long time (lots of drumstics),\nand your chars level up in-game, it creates for a much more interesting\nlong-term level.\nCharacter respawn: also useful for arena maps, and just nice overall when\nwanted.\n- Zardus\n\n\n\n"}}
