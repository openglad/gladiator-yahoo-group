I requested such a program and its location is \nhttp://sluggy.net/glad/ .  I suggest you try it for yourself.\n\nMy biggest problem with using only the built-in scenarios is &#39;Lake \nTracona&#39;.  Who needs to bother cheating to gain more money, when you \ncan spend hours at &#39;Lake Tracona&#39; building up experience for your \ncleric(s).  That is the biggest reason I want checkpoints for a \ntournament.  Every 2-3 weeks, when assumedly you have completed five \nscenarios or so, you send your saved file in.  The judges you use the \nabove program to verify you are not going through extra scenarios and \nextract basic stats about your team to post to the group.  If anybody \nthinks a person is cheating by looking at the stats, that person can \nchallenge.  All judges will work through it those scenarios up to that \npoint to check.  If there are no prizes, why would someone bother \ncheating to gain lots of extra money?\n\n\n"}}
