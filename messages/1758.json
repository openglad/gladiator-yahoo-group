The idea is \n&gt; somebody picks a theme and participants design a scenario within a \n&gt; month&#39;s time around that theme.  At the end of the month, we&#39;d use \na \n&gt; poll to vote on the best scenario around picked theme for the month.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is enough interest, it would be a group decision on the \ntheme \n&gt; of the month unless somebody else has a better way to pick the \ntheme.\n\n\n"}}
