I have\ngot to figure out the size I want to use.  I don&#39;t plan on making the\nadvanced thumbnails flexible in size.\n\nAlso, I have some other good news: With a lot of reading and testing\nof some addin, I should be able to get Jesse to save the thumbnail\nimages as . . JPGs.\n\n* * *\n\nOk, truthfully, I would rather solve an extremely complicated math\nproblem than write.  This translates into meaning that documentation\nmight be . . sketchy for a while.\n\nAlso, I&#39;m looking into taking text output from a maze generating\nprogram and converting into a scenario map.\n\n* * *\n\nAlso, I have this great idea for a scenario that&#39;s a cross between\n&quot;The Weakest Link&quot; and &quot;The Large Army&quot; from my set.  What?  You don&#39;t\nknow what those maps look like? \nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofules/glad/SCEN137.bmp and\nhttp://www.cei.net/~dphofrules/glad/SCEN161.bmp\n\n* * *\n\nYou know, whenever the official Gladiator website goes back up, I&#39;ll\nprobably end up putting at least 10 megabytes of stuff on it the 1st\nday if I keep this pace up.\n\n\n"}}
