Sounds like a good idea, right?  Wrong.  The damn druids \nbasically covered their entire spot with trees and their protective \nspells so much that it slowed the game down.  I might try again with \ndruids that have just enough experience to summon faeries, but not do \nanything else besides creating faeries.\n\n\n"}}
