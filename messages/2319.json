L=\r\nately, I&#39;ve been\nusing Java to graph mathematical equations. \nhttp://home.w=\r\nindstream.net/melvinsh/applets/dph-applets.htm - a list\nof my applets.  Any=\r\nways, what I&#39;m trying to graph a math equation.\n\nImagine that you have 5 po=\r\nints (p1 - p5) randomly located on a graph.\n Then you pick another point (p=\r\n6) and find out that if you took the\nsum of the distance from p1 to p6, the=\r\n distance from p2 to p6, the\ndistance from p3 to p6, the distance from p4 t=\r\no p6, and the distance\nfrom p5 to p6 is a constant c.  You might wonder wha=\r\nt other points\nbeside p6 fit the same criteria that p6 fits.  That&#39;s what I=\r\n&#39;m trying\nto graph.  Since distance taking square roots, I wasn&#39;t happy wit=\r\nh\nthat because it eliminates potential points.  So using algebra I&#39;ve\nexpan=\r\nded the equation to eliminate all the square roots.  The\nresulting expansio=\r\nn is 3 1/4 pages double spaced.  The math is so\nbad/complex that I had to u=\r\nse a website to help me expand it -\nhttp://www.quickmath.com/ .  Entering 3=\r\n 1/4 pages of mathematical\nexpressions without typos is . . difficult.  The=\r\n good news is I&#39;m\nhalfway through double checking the expressions for error=\r\ns.\n**End so far off-topic that ain&#39;t funny**\n\nWhat I plan on doing first is=\r\n getting some basic graphics to work:\n1)ability to draw any map with distin=\r\nct dimensions - I already did\nthis in another language\n2)draw a character(s=\r\n) on the map.\n3)have said character walk around in an octagonal pattern, to=\r\n\ndemonstrate walking forwards/backwards, up/down, and all possible\ndiagonal=\r\n movement.\n\n\n"}}
