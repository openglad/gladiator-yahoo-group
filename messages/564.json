Thanks for the info, dph.\n\nAnd a big thanks to Tom, for providing the documentation.\n\nI&#39;m using scen300.fss as my template for analysis, since it&#39;s v8 already.\n\nWatch out for big-endian/little-endian problems if you&#39;re used to one or the other.. it took me quite a while to figure out why nothing matched up quite the way I thought it would. ^^;\n\n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt;    // 1-byte version #\nThis is 0x08 (08h) not &#39;8&#39; in ASCII. We don&#39;t need backwords compatability in this editor, do we? He offered a work-around anyways.\n\nMost scenarios will need converted up to v8. Scenario 1, 2, 3, etc... are all v6. Some of them are even v5.\n\nI wonder which version began using v8 maps...\n\n&gt;    // 8-byte string = grid name to load\nThis apparently has something to do with the internal name of the file;\n&quot;SCEN0000&quot;, &quot;SCEN0030&quot;, etc..\n\nIt doesn&#39;t seem to be *that* important, and could probably default to the filename (assuming it&#39;s 8.3)\n\n&gt;    // 30-byte scenario title (ver 6+)\n\nStandard C String -- null terminated, then padded with garbage to get to the 30th byte.\n\n&gt;    // 1-byte char = scenario type, default is 0\n\nI guess non-0 is for deathmatch. I&#39;m not gonna bother looking (mainly &#39;cause I dunno where the DM levels are stored. ;))\n\nActually, when I converted scen1.fss to v8, it came up with a &#39;1&#39; rather than a &#39;0&#39;. Odd.\n\n&gt;    // 2-bytes par-value, v.8+\n\nHow fast you&#39;re supposed to complete the level, in hex, it seems. Unsigned, too.\n\n&gt;    // 2-bytes (short) = total objects to follow\n\nunsigned, or signed? I doubt anyone&#39;s map would even begin to approach THAT many objects... but nonetheless it&#39;s a possibility.\n\n&gt;    // List of n objects, each of 7-bytes of form:\n&gt;           // 1-byte ORDER\n&gt;           // 1-byte FAMILY\n\nORDER of 0 seems to be a character (either friend or foe):\nbecause ORDER 0x00 FAMILY 0x00 is a warrior.. and ORDER 0x00 FAMILY 0x02 is an archer..\n\n&gt;           // 2-byte short xpos\n&gt;           // 2-byte short ypos\nYou said you could make new map-sizes by making blank .pix files and converting them to maps? How large are &#39;average&#39; maps? Is this a pixel-by-pixel thing? Or is it a block-by-block thing?\n\n&gt;           // 1-byte TEAM\n\n0x00 is red?\n0x01 is blue?\n0x02 is yellow?\n0x03 is green?\n0x04 is purple?\n\n... those are just guesses. Maybe someone&#39;ll be able to figure something out.\n\n&gt;           // 1-byte facing\n0x01 is north, going clockwise, maybe?\n&gt;           // 1-byte command\n...It&#39;d be nice to get a list of these, too...\n&gt;           // 1-byte level // 2 bytes in version 7+\n&gt;           // 12-bytes name\nNamed characters appear in the status window when they die.. thus, it&#39;s probably best if most characters have 0x00 for their first letter of their name and then gibberish for the rest (standard C string)\n\n&gt;           // 10 bytes reserved\nIn every map, I think it&#39;s always &quot;MSTRMSTRMS&quot;.. but since it&#39;s reserved (ie; unused) I doubt it&#39;ll matter if that gets changed.\n\n&gt;    // 1-byte # of lines of text to load\n&gt;    // List of n lines of text, each of form:\n&gt;           // 1-byte character width of line\n&gt;           // m bytes == characters on this line\n\nSimple enough to figure out.\n\nAnyone else have any programming thoughts on the matter?\n\n-George &quot;Cookie&quot; Phillips\nAnime News Network\nCo-Editor-In-Chief\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com\n\n\n"}}
