They are very brave, (anyone seen\nsomethingawful.com&#39;s FPS guidelines?) and will run at the bad guys, thereby\ndiscarding any possibility of personal safety for the team.\n\nThe problem with this, is that sometimes your level 5 cleric will try and\nattack\nthat level 8 warrior, at the very moment the rest of the team is preoccupied\nwith\nTorvald the terrible.\n\nMy remedy for this is to use a small team, and use the shout button often.\nIf\nworking on a fairly difficult level that is swarming with foes, you should\nlead\nyour group with your slowest group member.  Mages, I find, are really good\nfor\nleading a group because they have fireballs that do considerable initial\ndamage,\nand being able to see what&#39;s coming up with a character like that so you can\n\nget him out of the way is a good idea.\n\nIt&#39;s also been my policy, that for an efficient team you should have at\nleast two\nclerics.  One cleric is prone to hurt himself and have nowhere to go for\nhealing\nexcept for the health that may be on the other side of the map in a large\nlevel,\nwhile two can keep each other in good shape and also keep the area secure\nwith a deadly barrier of mystic maces.\n\nMy team?  Two clerics and one mage.  I&#39;ve been debating with myself what is\nbetter, an archmage or a mage -- the archmage has some powerful destruction\nspells, but no archmage can compete with the flame-throwing power of the\nmage&#39;s energy blast.  And who can resist stop time?  So it&#39;s up to you.  I\nalways\nuse one of these, however, as my leading PC, because they are slower than\nthe\nclerics and will remain that way for most of the game if you keep the\nclerics&#39;\ndexterities at even levels with the mages.  I can switch quickly between the\ntwo\nclerics, setting up fields of mystic mace that protect the rear end of the\nteam from\nmelee attacks, as well as healing up the other members of my team quickly\nwith\na quick switch and heal.\n\nDuring the first few levels, this team pathetic.  They are too slow to keep\nup with\nCommander and Troy, unless you call those two in and go deliberately ahead\nto\ntry and beat off those elves in the first level.  They are prone to an easy\ndeath if\nyou don&#39;t take special care to keep the clerics healing up, and the clerics\nare pretty\nweak too until you get their intelligence up to the point where they can use\nmystic\nmace.  Once you get mystic mace on one of your clerics, then you&#39;re rolling\n-- but\nuntil that point, you are going to be struggling (especially on battle or\nslaughter\nmode!). Hope that helps.\n\nre: fifty levels\n\nAwesome, Tevildo. I will be checking them out shortly -- thanks a lot for\nputting\nthose up there for us all to enjoy.\n\n-Chris/Shayd\n\n\n\n"}}
