The\ntournament, as it currently stands, will have to be offline.\n\nCheckpoints - Before you start going through the tournament scenarios\nand after you hire character(s), send your initial saved game in to\nthe judges.  This one is only for reference.  After that, every time a\n  person completes 5 scenarios, send your saved game in to the judges.\n\n\nCheating -  To prevent cheating, once all the players have completed a\nset of 5 scenarios, the judges will post all the stats of each\nplayer&#39;s team.  If anyone thinks a player is cheating, that person can\npost a message challenging the person&#39;s stats.  One or more judges\nwill go through the scenarios to check out the claim.   if at any time\na person is found to be cheating, that person will be immediately\nexpelled from the tournament.\n\nOptional Rules - By the time a player has completed the 1st five\nscenarios, all the members of his/her team must be hired.  In return,\nall scenarios will be pre-checked to sure that no player will be so\noverwhelmed with a scenario that he/she will need to buy extra\ncharacters to help defeat one scenario.\n\nGoal of the tournament - To have the highest score after completing\nall scenarios.\n\nTie Breakers: the following is a list in order of how to break ties:\n   1)the player with no (or fewest) clerics\n   2)the player with no (or fewest) ghosts\n   3)the player with no (or fewest) faeries\n   4)the player with no (or fewest) skeletons and/or mages\n   5)the player with no (or fewest) elves\n   Obviously, we need a very long list of how to break ties.  But\nbeyond the 1st five, I am not quite sure how to break ties without\nstepping on somebody&#39;s toes.  Any more suggestions would be\nappreciated and any challenges on the existing proposed ways to break\nties would be welcome.\n\nScenarios - A set of people will work on choosing and preparing the\nscenarios for the tournament.  Each set of 5 will be zipped together\nand assigned a unique password by somebody not playing in the\ntournament.  One of the goals of choosing and preparing scenarios is\nthe impossibility of any player ending up with an archmage and/or a\ncleric who can summon skeletons.  No character should exceed\nexperience level 4 after completing the tournament scenarios.\n\n--- In gladiator@y..., &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@y...&gt;\nwrote:\n &gt; &gt; If I have anything to do with picking/editing scenarios, there\nwill\n &gt; be\n &gt; &gt; no way to end with an archmage by the end of the tournament and/or\n &gt; end\n &gt; &gt; with a cleric who could summon skeletons without cheating.\n &gt;\n &gt; Also, I also want to raise another point: before tournament starts,\n &gt; the judges will know beforehand maximum possible scores at each\npoint\n &gt; in the tournament.  There is a gladiator file checker (\n &gt; http://sluggy.net/glad/ ) to determine which scenarios you have\n &gt; visited.  Putting those two facts together should be a very strong\n &gt; deterent to would-be cheaters.\n &gt;\n &gt; How do I propose knowing max scores?  I would propose is someone\n &gt; beforehand creating a very powerfull character to send through the\n &gt; tournament scenarios {I already have a scenario designed for such a\n &gt; purpose], going through each scenario at &#39;Slaughter&#39; level.  Record\n &gt; the initial the score being going through  After 5 scenarios or so,\n &gt; right down the score.\n &gt;\n &gt; The only other way I could see cheating is someone substiting out\n &gt; tournament scenarios by creating new scenarios with the tournament\n &gt; numbers.  To nip that problem in the bud, only the judges will know\n &gt; max possible scores.  Futhermore, IMHO putting together the\ntournament\n &gt; scenarios and deciding which numbers to use will be done rather\n &gt; secretly (in another yahoo group) and the tournament scenarios will\n &gt; only be sent to the players the same day the tournament starts to\n &gt; prevent possible substitution of tournament scenarios.  Futhermore,\nI\n &gt; propose zipping the tournament scenarios up in bundles of 5 with a\n &gt; different password for each set just to make substituting out\n &gt; scenarios all but too time consuming to keep from being caught.\n &gt;\n &gt; I know I sound rather paranoid about cheaters, but I want the\nresults\n &gt; of 1st gladiator tournament to be as uncontroversial as possible.\nIf\n &gt; there is another to cheat that I haven&#39;t figured a way around, let\nme\n &gt; know.  I know some of the rules sound restrictive, but they are only\n &gt; around just to make the tournament fun for everyone involved.\n &gt;\n &gt; One of these years, I would love to see a tournament where all of us\n &gt; gather to one central location to play gladiator.  More\nrealistically\n &gt; [I&#39;m not so sure this is more realistic),  if G:BF ever gets\nfinished,\n &gt;  I would love to have an internet tournament.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
