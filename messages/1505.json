In my scenario \n#160 (Release of Sun Bai), I frequently walk right by enemy fire \nelementals without being attacked.  In other scenarios, I can&#39;t walk \naround opponents without being attacked.  \n\nAlso, stupidity occurs: one of my team members will frequently get \nstuck trying to go after an opponent when there is a wall between the \ntwo characters instead of going after the nearby opponent it can \nreach.\n\n\n"}}
