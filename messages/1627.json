I never really used it or Disarm because I\ncouldn&#39;t see any effect. Charge could be altered to\nautomatically target an opponent that&#39;s in front of\nthe soldier (perhaps in a 10-o&#39;clock-to-2-o&#39;clock\nrange)... that would increase it&#39;s usefulness.\nBoomerang should definitely be altered--a limit on the\nnumber of boomerangs that can be thrown, and a wider\nrange of spots at which the boomerang will cause\ndamage in its flight.\n\nElves--what can I say. They throw too many rocks. I\nused to run around after completing a mission,\nshooting down all the stray rocks that enemy elves had\nthrown that were still ricocheting around the map. I&#39;d\nlike to see a limit on the rocks an elf can throw at a\ntime... once the maximum (which would increase with\nlevel) had been reached, the previously thrown rocks\nwould disappear. Otherwise, the old rocks would\ncontinue and the elf would be helpless at close range.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo! Mail Plus - Powerful. Affordable.
