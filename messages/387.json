They&#39;re not particularly fun to play, and they&#39;re all basically\n&gt; set on the first map, South of Talwood. I noticed that they&#39;re designed so\n&gt; only a mage or archmage would have a fighting chance of winning...\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;d like to propose a new trainable stat:\n&gt; &quot;Not-running-around-like-a-chicken-with-its-head-cut-off&quot;. Even with a\n&gt; zillion armor, nearby explosions tend to send my characters prancing all\n&gt; over the screen, running here and there and subsequently getting scared by\n&gt; ghosts. I mean, how shocked and bewildered is an archmage with several\n&gt; hundred intelligence going to be if a tower he was shooting at blows up?\n&gt;\n&gt; Still working on various little Gladiator projects... when they&#39;re done I&#39;ll\n&gt; post them to my Gladiator site. The Warcraft II stuff I&#39;ve been doing has\n&gt; been much quicker to see completion, so I&#39;d better create a page for that\n&gt; too. Anyone else out there do levels for Gladiator AND Warcraft? It&#39;s so\n&gt; much easier to create a storyline with Gladiator, but Warcraft has ships and\n&gt; some decent magic...\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n"}}
