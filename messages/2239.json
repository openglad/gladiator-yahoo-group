I ended up with a B\nin vb.net 1.\n\nTh=\r\nat gives me time to finish up some goals:\n\n1)get Jesse v.02 ready to compil=\r\ne for distribution\n2)get James v.01 ready to compile for disribution\n\nWhat&#39;=\r\ns the heck Jesse v.02 and James v.01?\n\nJames v.01 is an application for sav=\r\ning data about map tiles for\nGladiator into a binary file.\n\nJesse v.02 will=\r\n use data files created by James v.01 to edit maps for\nthe games of gladiat=\r\nor.\n\nHow far long am I?\n\nI finally started to code James v.01 to get the da=\r\nta entry to work\n(moving it beyond just being a static gui).  All I have to=\r\n do is work\nout a file save format and I should be able to finish coding Ja=\r\nmes\nv.01 rather quickly.\n\nWhat&#39;s the status of Jesse v.02?\n\nObviously, it c=\r\nan&#39;t read the data files created by James v.01 since\nthey don&#39;t exist.  I g=\r\notta code both the Insert Row/Column feature and\nthe Delete Row/Column feat=\r\nure for maps and that&#39;s where I&#39;m stopping\non new features.  I, also, am go=\r\ning to try to put the thumbnail map\nfeatures from Jesse v.01 into Jesse v.0=\r\n2.  Obviously, from my pov at\nleast, I can&#39;t put the thumbnail features fro=\r\nm Jesse v.01 into Jesse\nv.02 until AFTER James v.01 is finished AND Jesse v=\r\n.02 reads the data\nfiles created by James v.01.\n\nIs there any other stuff f=\r\nor gladiator that I&#39;m thinking of working on?\n\nUmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm=\r\nmmmmmm.  Yes.  It&#39;s contigent upon how\nhard it is/will be to get James v.01=\r\n to work like I want it.\n\nTell me more.\n\nOk, since you wanted to know.  Whe=\r\nn I started working on James v.01\nagain, It occured to me the similarities =\r\nbetween the data files that\nJames v.01 will create and the fss files used t=\r\no store the data about\nscenario files.  I *might* be able to write a progra=\r\nm to view the\nobjects in a scenario file like you view records in a table i=\r\nn a\ndatabase.  Such a program is on the list of items potentially to be\nput=\r\n on my backburner.\n\nWhat aren&#39;t you telling us?\n\nD&#39;uh, my time is limited. =\r\n I plan on attending a convention during the\nsummer called &quot;The Gathering o=\r\nf the Gargoyles&quot; -\nhttp://www.gatheringofthegargoyles.com/ .  It&#39;s an annua=\r\nl convention\nfor those who love gargoyles the tv series.  I&#39;m paying for my=\r\n way\nthere as a present for myself for graduating college.  I started to\nwo=\r\nrk on a gargoyles card modelled after yugioh except the cards\nreflect thing=\r\ns from the universe of the gargoyles.  As soon as I\nfinish work on James v.=\r\n01 and Jesse v.02, I plan on moving work on\nthat card game from my back bur=\r\nner to my front burner.  My goal is to\nhave the game ready by the conventio=\r\nn.  I have a yahoo group for\nworking on it - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\ngarg-card-game/ - but\nthat&#39;s nothing for you guys to worry about.  I only m=\r\nention it to\nexplain why I plan on stopping where I plan on stopping work o=\r\nn\ngladiator related programs.\n\nD&#39;uh, I will be putting my source code at sn=\r\nowstorm&#39;s sourceforge webiste.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
