I&#39;m sure a few more rules will be proposed just before the \n to=\r\nurnament is supposed to start.  I am guessing at least 1 month to \nget the =\r\nscenarios prepared for a tournament.  Wait a minute, I haven&#39;t \nincluded en=\r\nough time to test the scenarios to ensure nobody can \npotentially end up wi=\r\nth a cleric who can raise skeletons or end up \nwith an archmage.  Of course=\r\n, I am counting on the scenario extraction \nand scenario encryption program=\r\ns to help speeed things up by making it \neasier to lower [maybe raise, but =\r\nI doubt it] experience levels of \nopponents.  Another thing is how long it =\r\ntakes to select scenarios (I \nam leaning towards using mostly built-in ones=\r\n and including 1 or 2 of \nTelvido&#39;s and 1 or 2 of mine).  After selecting s=\r\ncenarios, rework \nmight (for my scenarios, &#39;will&#39; applies) have to be done =\r\nto ensure \nthat they aren&#39;t too hard.  But before I start to work on gettin=\r\ng \ntournament scenarios ready, I want a minimum number of people \ncommittin=\r\ng towards playing in a tournament.  I imagine more people \nwill be willing =\r\nto commit toward playing in a tournament once the \nrules are published.  If=\r\n a minimum number of people aren&#39;t willing to \ncommit once the rules are co=\r\nmpleted, the rules will still be around, \nbut there will be no tournament.\n=\r\n\n\n&gt; _,.-~=3D&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=3D~-.,_,.-~=3D&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=3D~-.,_,.-~=3D&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=3D=\r\n~-.,_\n&gt; =A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8=B8,=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8=A4=BA=B0`=\r\n=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8=B8,=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8=B8,=\r\n=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8\n&gt; -Terry\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower=\r\n&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@y...&gt;\n&gt; Reply-To: gladiator@y...\n&gt; To: gladiator@y...\n&gt; Sub=\r\nject: [gladiator] Re: Tournament Rules, Part 1\n&gt; Date: Sat, 30 Jun 2001 07:=\r\n13:56 -0000\n&gt; \n&gt;  &gt; If I have anything to do with picking/editing scenarios=\r\n, there \nwill\n&gt; be\n&gt;  &gt; no way to end with an archmage by the end of the to=\r\nurnament \nand/or\n&gt; end\n&gt;  &gt; with a cleric who could summon skeletons withou=\r\nt cheating.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, I also want to raise another point: before tournamen=\r\nt starts,\n&gt; the judges will know beforehand maximum possible scores at each=\r\n \npoint\n&gt; in the tournament.  There is a gladiator file checker (\n&gt; http://=\r\nsluggy.net/glad/ ) to determine which scenarios you have\n&gt; visited.  Puttin=\r\ng those two facts together should be a very strong\n&gt; deterent to would-be c=\r\nheaters.\n&gt; \n&gt; How do I propose knowing max scores?  I would propose is some=\r\none\n&gt; beforehand creating a very powerfull character to send through the\n&gt; =\r\ntournament scenarios {I already have a scenario designed for such a\n&gt; purpo=\r\nse], going through each scenario at &#39;Slaughter&#39; level.  Record\n&gt; the initia=\r\nl the score being going through  After 5 scenarios or so,\n&gt; right down the =\r\nscore.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only other way I could see cheating is someone substiting o=\r\nut\n&gt; tournament scenarios by creating new scenarios with the tournament\n&gt; n=\r\numbers.  To nip that problem in the bud, only the judges will know\n&gt; max po=\r\nssible scores.  Futhermore, IMHO putting together the \ntournament\n&gt; scenari=\r\nos and deciding which numbers to use will be done rather\n&gt; secretly (in ano=\r\nther yahoo group) and the tournament scenarios will\n&gt; only be sent to the p=\r\nlayers the same day the tournament starts to\n&gt; prevent possible substitutio=\r\nn of tournament scenarios.  Futhermore, \nI\n&gt; propose zipping the tournament=\r\n scenarios up in bundles of 5 with a\n&gt; different password for each set just=\r\n to make substituting out\n&gt; scenarios all but too time consuming to keep fr=\r\nom being caught.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know I sound rather paranoid about cheaters, but I =\r\nwant the \nresults\n&gt; of 1st gladiator tournament to be as uncontroversial as=\r\n possible.  \nIf\n&gt; there is another to cheat that I haven&#39;t figured a way ar=\r\nound, let \nme\n&gt; know.  I know some of the rules sound restrictive, but they=\r\n are only\n&gt; around just to make the tournament fun for everyone involved.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; One of these years, I would love to see a tournament where all of us\n&gt; =\r\ngather to one central location to play gladiator.  More \nrealistically\n&gt; [I=\r\n&#39;m not so sure this is more realistic),  if G:BF ever gets \nfinished,\n&gt;   I=\r\n would love to have an internet tournament.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n______________________=\r\n________________________________________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Fr=\r\nee E-mail from MSN Hotmail at \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
