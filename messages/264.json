For pete&#39;s\nsake, those faeries freeze mages and archmages (my favorite\ncharacters) longer than anything else.  Yep, they freeze a fire\nelemental and clerics for less time with the same hit.  Why?\n\nThat brings me to an interesting question:  Is there anything in the\ngame that would keep a team of 1 from being frozen in place\nINDEFINITELY?  I mean a character could be surrounded by faeries and\ncontiniously fired upon and never have a chance to respond because of\nthe damn faeries.\n\nOne more thing that bothers me about characters being frozen in\nplace:\nI had an archmage frozen in place and I could not make him do\nanything.  However, a few moments later (while the archmage was\nfrozen\n  in place), the archmage summoned chain lightning.  Please explain\nthat one to me.\n\nOne more question:  is there anything that can BOTH block faeries\nfrom\n  passsing through it AND allow character&#39;s attacks to penetrate it?\n-The red door should work-\nI\ntried using rock tiles but faeries can still cross those.  If there\nis\nsuch a tile, I would like to know ASAP so I can redesign a certain\nscenario (#118) which I just finished.  That makes 3 original\nscenarios from me.\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
