Either we \ntake up discussion about a tournament and its rules, about possible \nfeatures for Gladiator:Beyond Freedom, or about starting &#39;The 50 \nProject&#39;, or this discussion board goes dead again.\n\nI expected between talk about working on new scenarios as a group and \nworking on a tournament to have some messages being posted today.  Oh \nwell.\n\nI would say that I am thinking about plans for a 2nd gladiator \ntournament, but those plans depend on some success and learning from \nmistakes from a 1st gladiator tournament.\n\n\n"}}
