[If you have a suggested topic, email me!!] One of my goals is \nto have a steady stream of discussion for this group (~30 messages  \nper month).  Once we finish up with the character evaluations and go \nthrough the hybrid/dual class discussion, I do not plan on hitting \nthose topics again until January of next year.\n\nWhen we finish the proposed new promoted character classes, we&#39;ll be \nhitting a discussion about health and mana for characters.\n\nAfter that, the topics are:\n\n1)3 weeks of hybrid/dual class character.  I&#39;ll be tackling this in 3 \nparts.\n\n2)Game Issues of Potion of Speed, Speed, and Teleporters\n\n3)Game Issues of Generators\n\n4)Game Issues of Experience Points & Experience Levels\n\n5)Game Issues of Basic Intelligence for characters\n\n6)Games Issues of Explosions and character&#39;s response to those\n\n7)Scenario Trivia Contest - two to three weeks\n\n8)Review of dph&#39;s scenarios - the good, bad, and ugly.  That will take \na 3 weeks (maybe more).\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nScenario Trivia Contest Questions\nI am only referencing scenarios that have been uploaded by March 31, \n2001 or modified and uploaded afterwards.\n\nThe first seven are objective questions:\n\n1)List all the scenarios that are especially difficult for mages and \narchmages.\n2)List all the scenarios that are especially difficult for skeletons \nand ghosts.\n3)List all the scenarios that are difficult for fire elementals and \nlarge slime.\n4)List all the scenarios that are easier for elves.\n5)List all the scenarios that take at least 30 minutes to complete.\n6)List all the scenarios in dph&#39;s set that use the same map or \nmoderately altered version of an existing map.\n7)Name the author of the Tyrx Chronicles.\n\nThis are the subjective questions:\n\n8)Name the hardest scenario to beat and justify your answer.  I do NOT \n want an answer about that scenario being the hardest to beat because \nit has the highest experience level opponents, the most opponents, or \nsome combination of the previous two.  I am looking for something \nbeyond that.\n9)Name the scenario that has the best NPCs and justify your answer.\n10)Name the scenario that has the most usefull NPCs and justify your \nanswer.\n11)Name the most annoying scenario to go through and justify your \nanswer.\n12)Name the most annoying set of scenarios to go through and justify \nyour answer.\n13)Name the most fun scenario to go through and justify your answer.\n14)Name the scenario that takes the longest amount of time to complete \nand explain why it takes so darn long.\n\nRules\n1)Don&#39;t email the group with the answers to these questions.\n2)Answers should be emailed to ME with the message title of &quot;Scenario \nTrivia Contest&quot;.\n3)I should receive answers starting from the start of the week we hit \nthe discussion about generators through the middle of the week we hit \ndiscussion about explosions.  If you are concerned about your email \nbeing delivered on time, twice a week I will be posting whom I \nreceived answers from.  Also, send it early if you are concerned about \nemail being delivered on time.\n4)I&#39;ll be posting answers to the objective questions.\n5)The answers to the subjective questions will be decided by group \nconsensus.  I&#39;ll bring the question up and the various answers (along \nwith the justifications) and we will debate it.\n6)75% of the points will be coming from the objective questions.  I \nshouldn&#39;t have to mention what percentage of the points will be coming \n from the subjective questions.\n\nAre there any questions about the questions or suggestions about more \nquestions to add?\n\n\n"}}
