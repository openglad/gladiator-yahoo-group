Chain lightning will basically slow down any computer (trust\n&gt;  me, I&#39;ve tried it with 1 ghz and 128 meg of RAM) to a halt if you use\n&gt;  it against more than 15-20 opponents. &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; How it slows down your computer I don&#39;t know.  I&#39;ve used chain lighting\n&gt; against hundreds of foes at once with a 1.1 ghz with 128 megs of ram\nwithout\n&gt; any slowdown whatsoever.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
