You can also use it to change all tiles of a particular type into\nanother type instantly. I suggest that everyone make a palette .PIX file\nwith samples of all 134 usable tiles, which you can pull up in Scen.exe for\neasy access to any map pieces you could ever need. I&#39;d simply send you mine,\nbut the Mailing List rules say no attachments. Anyway, I hope everyone can\nuse Editor successfully, as it&#39;s a powerful tool. I may use it to alter the\ncharacter images one of these days, but I have other projects to work on\nfirst. Best of luck,\n          -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n                  (http://hotyellow98.com/tevildo/glad.html)\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at\nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
