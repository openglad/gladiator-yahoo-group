My mega-archmage has summoned elves that could stay in a \nforest and launch their most powerfull attacks without running out of \nmagical energy.  Admittedly, that is advantageous, but trick shouldn&#39;t \nbe.  The fire elementals summoned by my mega-archmage will never be \nable to run out of magical energy.  I forgot how high experience level \nyou have to give a Golem for him not to run out of magical energy.  I \nwould propose making the amount energy available for an attack related \nto the total max magical energy use available.  Effectively, this \nwould make attacks stronger.\n\nThis brings me to another point:  if a summoned image/firre elemental \nshould exceed max limits for magical energy and/or health, the value \ndisplayed should be the max limit.\n\nI do have a proposed new attack for a fire elemental: suicide.  The \nfire elemental could convert all of its health and magical energy into \none super-powerfull starburst or all at a single direction, with \nflames continiung until all the energy is absorbed.  Suicide would \nonly be available at experience level 4 or higher.  Use of this attack \nwould have to be approved by the player for non-summoned fire \nelementals [Suicide would NOT drain health from an archmage if a \nsummoned fire elemental decided to].  The fire elemental could request \npermission only once a minute.  \n\n\n"}}
