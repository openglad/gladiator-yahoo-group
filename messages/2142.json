I\nadded support for the &quot;exit anytime&quot; scenario type. Apparently, the\nGladiator source we originally received didn&#39;t have support for the\nother exit types, besides killing everyone and saving named npcs. At\nleast, none that I could find.\n\nI don&#39;t have any Windows dev tools so I am unable to make a Windows\nrelease though. I will talk to Yan and see if he can do it.\n\nSean\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Grand Master Gladiator&quot;\n&lt;grandmaster_gladiator@y...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; --- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alternate_dph&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Easy, in one of my scenarios, where you rescue the God of the\n&gt; Undead,\n&gt; &gt; he is much weaker in his 1st appearance than in his next\n&gt; appearance. \n&gt; &gt; Why?  Plotwise, the presence of runes (aka towers) was making him\n&gt; &gt; weak.  Anyways, you really should defeat every scenario to go to the\n&gt; &gt; next one. Maybe have the grunts of the 2 armies fight each other\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; a weak sub-commander would help.\n&gt; \n&gt; *frowns*, but making everyone beatable would ruin the current plot. \n&gt; It wouldn&#39;t be hard to make everyone beatable, but on Nylwin Town you\n&gt; can leave the level at any time (even without beating every enemy);\n&gt; I&#39;d like my level to be like that.  I used deathifier&#39;s GladScenConv\n&gt; program (great prog BTW) and saw entries like &quot;Scenario Type: 0 (Kill\n&gt; all Monsters)&quot; and &quot;Scenario Type: 2 (Must kill generators)&quot;.  What&#39;s\n&gt; the line of code to use to make it &quot;leavable anytime&quot; so I can use\n&gt; GladScenConv (again really nice prog thanks deathifier) for\n&gt; converstion purposes?\n\n\n"}}
