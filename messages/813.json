Only 1 small\nthing, though.  That scenario is designed to have enough gold to bring\ncharacters beyond experience level 100.  I created that scenario so I\nwould have a fast way of evaluating each characters where essentially\nthe only weaknesses (and something else listed below) of the\ncharacters are the available attacks.\n\nOne side note, though.  All of the characters I have tried at\nexperience level 100+ have problems using teleporters because they run\ntoo fast.  I believe they run at least twice as fast as their attacks.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
