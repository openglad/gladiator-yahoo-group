I was thinking about taking\nthe average experience level of the saved game team, mutiplying that\nby 3/4 to come up with approximate experience level numbers for your\nopposition.\n\nThis something I&#39;d really like to have: characters in scenarios whose\nstrength is always a close approximation to your own team.\n\nThis is an idea for Open Glad Enhanced, essentially producing dynamic\nscenarios where it plays well for a beginner team and adjusts itself\nto be harder for a well-experienced team.\n\n\n"}}
