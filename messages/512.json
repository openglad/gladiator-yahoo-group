I will have to email this group owner before I \n&gt;feel free to discuss my proposed solution.\n\nThis is a problem?\n\nA lot of discussion on this list recently has been based around scenario development, which only a few people do or understand well.\n\n&quot;Should you account for Fire Elementals when designing tight cooridors?&quot;\n&quot;Can you rope off an area of the map so that only flyers and teleporting mages can enter?&quot;\n&quot;What&#39;s the proper set of levels for a tournament?&quot;\netc...\n\nThese kinds of questions are something that an average player doesn&#39;t need to concern themselves with. They&#39;re content as long as &quot;it works&quot;. (Sorry if I offend anyone with my general statements; I&#39;m referring to the dev-gaming community as a whole, not just Gladiator or the Gladiator ML, but am using Gladiator as an example since it&#39;s something we&#39;re all familiar with)\n\nAdditionally, some players don&#39;t develop maps but enjoy seeing others work&#39;s, and find this the best place to learn about them. Why should they write? These people are true lurkers, who have no reason to respond to anything, but merely quietly read everything that&#39;s being said.\n\nIt doesn&#39;t help that the level editor provided by FSGames is difficult to use (unless I&#39;ve been in the dark and simply haven&#39;t seen a better editor) if you don&#39;t already know what you&#39;re doing, discouraging budding level builders from creating good works.\n\nSo, I don&#39;t really share your concern that this inactivity is a problem, given the recent discussions this mailing list has produced.\n\n-George &quot;Cookie&quot; Phillips\nAnime News Network\nCo-Editor-In-Chief\nhttp://www.animenewsnetwork.com\n\n\n"}}
