If you start with a slime with experience level between 100 and 200, they usually stop \nmultiplying because of the reach the artificial limit on the number of characters in the screen. [An interesting experiment\nmight be what would happen if you disabled the limit and you had a very, very large field to play on so that the problem \nwith multiplying became a lack of space.  Could you ever hope to beat that scenario?]\n\n  Also, they stop multiplying\nbecause their mana reaches 50.  I&#39;ve also had generic slime of experience level 5 show up.  I think it might be after a \nslime mutliplies x number of times, every new slime formed from that one becomes generic.\n  \n&gt; Well, i haven&#39;t played gladiators for a couple of months.. but I remember well (due to a buncha experimentations!)\n\nI haven&#39;t had time to play Gladiator lately.\n  \n&gt; Anyways, hope that&#39;ll help.\n\nAny discussion helps.\n\n\n\n"}}
