They are very brave, (anyone seen\n&gt; somethingawful.com&#39;s FPS guidelines?) and will run at the bad guys,\nthereby\n&gt; discarding any possibility of personal safety for the team.\n&gt;\n&gt; The problem with this, is that sometimes your level 5 cleric will try and\n&gt; attack\n&gt; that level 8 warrior, at the very moment the rest of the team is\npreoccupied\n&gt; with\n&gt; Torvald the terrible.\n&gt;\n&gt; My remedy for this is to use a small team, and use the shout button often.\n&gt; If\n&gt; working on a fairly difficult level that is swarming with foes, you should\n&gt; lead\n&gt; your group with your slowest group member.  Mages, I find, are really good\n&gt; for\n&gt; leading a group because they have fireballs that do considerable initial\n&gt; damage,\n&gt; and being able to see what&#39;s coming up with a character like that so you\ncan\n&gt;\n&gt; get him out of the way is a good idea.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s also been my policy, that for an efficient team you should have at\n&gt; least two\n&gt; clerics.  One cleric is prone to hurt himself and have nowhere to go for\n&gt; healing\n&gt; except for the health that may be on the other side of the map in a large\n&gt; level,\n&gt; while two can keep each other in good shape and also keep the area secure\n&gt; with a deadly barrier of mystic maces.\n&gt;\n&gt; My team?  Two clerics and one mage.  I&#39;ve been debating with myself what\nis\n&gt; better, an archmage or a mage -- the archmage has some powerful\ndestruction\n&gt; spells, but no archmage can compete with the flame-throwing power of the\n&gt; mage&#39;s energy blast.  And who can resist stop time?  So it&#39;s up to you.  I\n&gt; always\n&gt; use one of these, however, as my leading PC, because they are slower than\n&gt; the\n&gt; clerics and will remain that way for most of the game if you keep the\n&gt; clerics&#39;\n&gt; dexterities at even levels with the mages.  I can switch quickly between\nthe\n&gt; two\n&gt; clerics, setting up fields of mystic mace that protect the rear end of the\n&gt; team from\n&gt; melee attacks, as well as healing up the other members of my team quickly\n&gt; with\n&gt; a quick switch and heal.\n&gt;\n&gt; During the first few levels, this team pathetic.  They are too slow to\nkeep\n&gt; up with\n&gt; Commander and Troy, unless you call those two in and go deliberately ahead\n&gt; to\n&gt; try and beat off those elves in the first level.  They are prone to an\neasy\n&gt; death if\n&gt; you don&#39;t take special care to keep the clerics healing up, and the\nclerics\n&gt; are pretty\n&gt; weak too until you get their intelligence up to the point where they can\nuse\n&gt; mystic\n&gt; mace.  Once you get mystic mace on one of your clerics, then you&#39;re\nrolling\n&gt; -- but\n&gt; until that point, you are going to be struggling (especially on battle or\n&gt; slaughter\n&gt; mode!). Hope that helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; re: fifty levels\n&gt;\n&gt; Awesome, Tevildo. I will be checking them out shortly -- thanks a lot for\n&gt; putting\n&gt; those up there for us all to enjoy.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Chris/Shayd\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Get 6 months of FREE* MSN Internet access!\n&gt; http://click.egroups.com/1/5727/9/_/490105/_/962645778/\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
