Basically, you get\na\n&gt; roughly n^2 (n-squared) processing time value, because each lightning\n&gt; object checks each possible enemy to see where it should head next,\n&gt; etc.  Thus, shooting it out when there are, say, 15 total characters on\nthe\n&gt; screen means a processing &quot;cost&quot; of around 225; bump that up to 50\n&gt; characters and you&#39;re up to 2500; move that up to 150 characters and\nyou&#39;re\n&gt; at 22500 -- 100x more processing time than with 15 characters.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, on fast systems (remember, Gladiator was programmed to run on a\n&gt; 286 or 386, so a p3 or p4 system is really fast for it!) plus enough real\n&gt; memory to keep everything local (without swapping to the hard drive or\n&gt; page-switching), that won&#39;t really matter, since even a heavily-bogged\ndown\n&gt; Gladiator is still only taking up 10-20% of your computer&#39;s efforts.\n&gt;\n&gt; --Tom\n&gt;\n&gt; At 01:18 PM 6/25/2001, you wrote:\n&gt; &gt;The algorithm they are using is likely inefficient and has a very high\n&gt; &gt;running cost, although it would have to be extreemely high cost and\n&gt; &gt;extreemely inefficient to choke a 1GHz with only a handful (10-20) of\n&gt; &gt;opponents.\n&gt; &gt;There&#39;s any number of reasons why its inefficient, the only people that\nknow\n&gt; &gt;anything about it are the programmers that wrote it :)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;However if the Forgotten Sages released the code for just the routine\nchain\n&gt; &gt;lightning uses we should be able to improve it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;- Deathifier\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;From: &lt;DanielBook@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &lt;gladiator@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Monday, June 25, 2001 1:12 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [gladiator] Re: Wish List Part 3\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a message dated 6/24/2001 2:09:04 PM Central Daylight Time,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dph_of_rules@... writes:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Archmages have chain-lightning and it is so badly coded that it\nisn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  funny.
