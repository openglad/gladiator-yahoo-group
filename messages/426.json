Who just got a girlfriend... : )  Tevildo \nis a HAPPY boy.\n\nAnyway, I keep my game site updated, so you can always see what my latest \nprojects are. I&#39;ve been working with emulation a bit, but you can see that \nfor yourself... anyone else out there make Warcraft II scenarios? I&#39;d like \nto see some for comparison... I only know of two people who do both \nGladiator and Warcraft, and it seems that these people tend to concentrate \non the combat (i.e. Gladiator-ish) elements of their Warcraft levels more \nthan the economy. Anyway, the site is http://uk.geocities.com/tevgames. I&#39;d \nbe glad to trade links with people...\n\n     -All your base are belong to Tevildo.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
