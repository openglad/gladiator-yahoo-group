Why \n15?  To make the effort somewhat worthwhile.  It will take several \nhours of work to get ready for the tournament (selecting \nscenarios and editing them/making new scenarios).  If any of my \nscenarios are to be used, they will have to edited to bring experience \nlevel of opponents and number of opponents down.\n\n**What&#39;s going on with Part 1?  What about the rest?**\nThis is going to be a four part discussion.  Part 1 is about the wish \nlist for a NEW scenario editor for gladiator.  Part 2 will be about a \nwish list for existing characters.  Part 3 will be about a wish list \nfor new characters and misc stuff.  Part 4 will be about the wish list \nfor Gladiator:Beyond Freedom, which I believe no person in this list \nhas played.\n\nI will ask replies to this topic be restricted to improvements for a \nnew scenario editor.  When I feel this topic is exhausted, I will \ncompile a list for a new scenario editor and start Part 2.\n\nHere&#39;s the first one:  Slow down feature for the mouse.  In a big \nscenario, it&#39;s too easy to move your mouse completely off screen from \nthe area you are working on.  Telvido, I expect you to have as many \nsuggestions about the scenario editor as I have.\n\n\n"}}
