Except for really small teams (4 or\n &gt; fewer), no single character should be able to exceed level 4.\n\nThe reasoning behind limiting experience (in my mind) was to keep\nteams roughly equal in abilities.  Remember the debate we had about\nthe game favoring 3 characters: clerics, mages, and archmages.\nClerics can summon reinforcements from dead opponents; mages can\nfreeze time, making virtually any scenario beatable; archmages can\nsummon images and fire elementals.  By keeping experience levels in\ncheck, I am hoping that this will help bring a greater variety of\nteams instead of everybody&#39;s team being virtually the same.\nFuthermore, the tie-breakers are about reinforcing the idea of a\nvariety of teams.\n\nI am strongly leaning towards 20 scenarios for this tournament.  At a\npace of 5 scenarios per 2 weeks, I am looking at taking 8 weeks to\ncomplete this tournament.  For that pace to work, every scenario in\nthe tournament must be beatable in 15 minutes or less or we lower the\nquota of scenarios per 2 weeks and increase the length of time to\ncomplete the tournament.  If this pace seems to slow [or too fast] for\nmost folks, I am open for suggestions.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
