Currently, I am working on a single scenario that is cash \nrich and enemy poor outside of the ones I am creating to be played on. \n  The goal of that scenario is to make it very easy for me to raise \ntons of money to create characters of experience level 100 and higher. \n In fact, I have put level 20,007 gold in that scenario.  \nUnfortunately, it did not give me enough money to bring an archer upto \nexperience level beyond 155.  But, on the other hand, my theory about \narmor level equaling the product of strength times experience level \nfor archers gives me sufficient protection from damage by my own \nweapons.\n\nI need a little help in making some of my newer scenarios more \nrealistic, specifically, the ones that occur in the ocean.  Yes, I am \nworked my way creating scenarios 116 to 132.  I still lack, umm, 4 \nscenarios in my current cycle.  Then, I will play test them, fix them, \nand start working on another cycle of scenarios.\n\nI have a quick question that will effect the development of scenarios \nin my next cycle:  does anyone want to attempt to take on mages (who \ncan freeze time) and archmages (who can mind control) whose experience \nlevels are higher than 15?  I am not inclined to use such opponents \nbecause of the potential extreme difficulty in defeating them \n(archmage mind controls your whole team or mage does severe damage \nwhile time is frozen).  If you do not speak up, those opponents will \nnot show up in my next cycle.\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Donna Der&quot; &lt;TheLegendaryLight@w...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt; Yeah i do have some lvs, but i have to finish them,   Well It is \nsupposed to\n&gt; be one giant scenario with a series of stages 46-100  If ya want, \nany lv\n&gt; makers other then myself out there want to look at them and help me \nfinish\n&gt; the rest of them, i think i have 46-90 done, but may need help with \nthe\n&gt; other 10.  hehehe and my last name is spelled with one R not 2 \nhehehe just\n&gt; to clarify\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This Has Been Another Message sent\n&gt; by Ricky Der, The Legendary\n&gt; Cleric and Wizard of Light\n\n\n\n"}}
