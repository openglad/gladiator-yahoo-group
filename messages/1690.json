It would make tower-defended doorways more\nperilous. I also think that towers should perhaps be\nmore resilient to missile attacks, so that people need\nto get close in order to destroy them. Towers, as they\nare, are weak against mages and archers. There&#39;s also\nthe possibility that they could act as\n&quot;detectors&quot;--much like the &quot;Magic Sentinel&quot; ability in\nWarcraft III, the towers would be able to see\ninvisible units within a certain range.\n   -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo you Yahoo!?\nYahoo!
