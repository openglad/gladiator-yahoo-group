There is a gladiator file checker (\nhttp://sluggy.net/glad/ ) to determine which scenarios you have\nvisited.  Putting those two facts together should be a very strong\ndeterent to would-be cheaters.\n\nHow do I propose knowing max scores?  I would propose is someone\nbeforehand creating a very powerfull character to send through the\ntournament scenarios {I already have a scenario designed for such a\npurpose], going through each scenario at &#39;Slaughter&#39; level.  Record\nthe initial the score being going through  After 5 scenarios or so,\nright down the score.\n\nThe only other way I could see cheating is someone substiting out\ntournament scenarios by creating new scenarios with the tournament\nnumbers.  To nip that problem in the bud, only the judges will know\nmax possible scores.  Futhermore, IMHO putting together the tournament\nscenarios and deciding which numbers to use will be done rather\nsecretly (in another yahoo group) and the tournament scenarios will\nonly be sent to the players the same day the tournament starts to\nprevent possible substitution of tournament scenarios.  Futhermore, I\npropose zipping the tournament scenarios up in bundles of 5 with a\ndifferent password for each set just to make substituting out\nscenarios all but too time consuming to keep from being caught.\n\nI know I sound rather paranoid about cheaters, but I want the results\nof 1st gladiator tournament to be as uncontroversial as possible.  If\nthere is another to cheat that I haven&#39;t figured a way around, let me\nknow.  I know some of the rules sound restrictive, but they are only\naround just to make the tournament fun for everyone involved.\n\nOne of these years, I would love to see a tournament where all of us\ngather to one central location to play gladiator.  More realistically\n[I&#39;m not so sure this is more realistic),  if G:BF ever gets finished,\n  I would love to have an internet tournament.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
