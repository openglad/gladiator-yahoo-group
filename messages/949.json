I can solve the rest of\n&gt; problem.  I am a member of the yahoo groups moderators list.  I&#39;ll\n&gt; send a personal email to the yahoo representatives there, explaining\n&gt; that we have permission to post the software there.\n\nAlrighty, i&#39;ll password the file then.\n\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;ll try to upload it once FS gives us the go-ahead,\n&gt; hopefully my  modem connection won&#39;t fall apart part way through it -\n&gt; does anyone know if yahoo can resume transfers\n&gt;\n&gt; I doubt it.\n\nSo do I :)  HTTP isn&#39;t the greatest uploading transmission protocol ...\n\n&gt; BTW, how long will it take you to upload the file?  It&#39;s been taking\n&gt; about a minute or so to upload my scenarios to the group area.\n\nQuite a while I&#39;m guessing.  My connection isn&#39;t ultra-fast, nor is it\nreliable (and even worse if it&#39;s via HTTP) so I may not be able to actually\nget it up.  What I will do is dump it onto my webpage, and either try to get\nYahoo to retrieve it from that or let someone with cable/ADSL/Company T1\ntransfer it :)\n\nI&#39;ll setup the upload tonight, I can resume the transfer to my ftp server so\nit should go through without any troubles by tomorrow night at the latest.\n\nCya,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
