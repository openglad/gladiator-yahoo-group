I guess that means that in all of\n&gt; the membership of this list, only 5 are truly devoted.\n&gt;\n&gt; Other - This are small suggestions:\n&gt;\n&gt; give mages the ability to slow down time for times as an alternate to\n&gt; freezing time.  that way you could still generate energy to use while\n&gt; fighting opponents.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another suggestion would be adding a new character class:  a\n&gt; character\n&gt; that can duplicate the specials of other characters, both friend and\n&gt; foe on the battlefield.  The only exception would be it can not\n&gt; duplicate slimes&#39;s ability.  That would make the game more\n&gt; interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, can you give faeries the ability to carry other characters\n&gt; across distances?\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you give mages the ability to create teleporters to spots where\n&gt; whey have laid a teleport marker?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n"}}
