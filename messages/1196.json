Thus it seems \nthe \n&gt; problem is not much of a problem at all. The reasonable choice, \nthen, \n&gt; would be to make elves&#39; attacks weaker as they travel through \n&gt; forests, which makes sense as trees do not generally stand aside for \n&gt; rocks.\n\nThat&#39;s what I think.  For really low experience levels, this effect \nwould almost unnoticeable.  But at very high experience levels, the \neffect would be noticeable.\n\nSomething like the attack loses a percentage of strength for every x \namount of time it travels in a forest.\n\n\n"}}
