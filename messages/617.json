May I suggest each one of you all\n&gt; potentially working on the new scenario editor, as proof of your\n&gt; knowledge, create a simple program to extract from the grid file, a\n&gt; list of objects in a grid and save the information to a text file and\n&gt; create a program to take said text file and convert it to a grid file?\n&gt;  I know that sounds simple enough, but is a nice way of proving your\n&gt; knowledge.\nSounds like a good idea and shouldn&#39;t take too long.\nYou&#39;ll have to wait till after the 29th for mine though, I&#39;ve got uni exams\ninterspersed between now and then so there isn&#39;t much time for anything else\n:(\n\nJust to clarify you want us to load/save this part of the file:\n\n// 2-bytes (short) = total objects to follow\n// List of n objects, each of 7-bytes of form:\n// 1-byte ORDER\n// 1-byte FAMILY\n// 2-byte short xpos\n// 2-byte short ypos\n// 1-byte TEAM\n// 1-byte facing\n// 1-byte command\n// 1-byte level // 2 bytes in version 7+\n// 12-bytes name\n\nShouldn&#39;t be too hard to extract them, any particular format you want the\ntext file in?  Perhaps one object per line, tab-delimited?\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
