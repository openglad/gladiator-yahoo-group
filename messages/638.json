The idea of \nsubmitting saved games after 5 scenarios or so and posting details \nfrom the saved games was my idea for the reasons stated above.  There \nare 2 polls out there right now dealing with the tournament: the 1st \nabout which scenarios to use and the 2nd about how many scenarios in \nthe tournament.\n\nI would rather have the discuss about the rules in this area, but I am \nafraid of boring people who are not interested in a tournament.  \nBesides rules for the tournament, there has to be discussion about \nwhat criteria to use for choosing scenarios for the tournament - I \nexpect that discussion to be rather heated.\n\n\n"}}
