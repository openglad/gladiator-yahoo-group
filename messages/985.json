Give them a wide area, you&#39;ll find \nit hard to walk around in a few minutes.  One thing puzzles me, \nthough.  Why doesn&#39;t bombs from a thief destroy nearby enemy trees?  \nPoison clouds have no effect on trees, thus leaving only the basic \nattack to clear your path.\n\nMy only regrets is I wish I had an attack that would just take out \nfaeries, trees, and those damn waves of protection the druid casts.  \nHmm.  I might give the druids level 500 potions of invulnverability.  \nWait a minute.  that might leave them stuck in a poison cloud.\n\n\n"}}
