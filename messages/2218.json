Seek, Flee, Flock (keep set distance to allies), A* and other \nuseful algorithms could be coded in &quot;C&quot; and made available to the AI \nscripts.\n\nIf you have MapLevel events and AI scripts both using the same \nscripting language, you will need to initialize two \nscript_core_engines and bind the appropriate functions seperately.  \nCan&#39;t have players drying out lakes and raining gold piles now!\n\nAngelScript is easy to integrate & use \nhttp://www.angelcode.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
