If you are going through a wooded \narea, if there was any NPCS, I would expect either an elf or a druid \nwho can summon faeries.\n\nMost of the NPCs in the built-in scenarios I consider to be too weak. \n In &#39;Tic and Tac&#39; for example, my own team is much stronger \nindividually than any of those NPCs.\n\n--- In gladiator@y..., &quot;dancing corpse&quot; &lt;dancing_corpse@h...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; some things:\n&gt; -get rid of troy and the commander, there always stealing exp from \nmy new \n&gt; guys\n\nThat&#39;s because where they are placed.  I do believe in some NPC to get \nyou started.  One of my 1st goals is to acquire my full team as soon \nas possible.  That will take about 3 scenarios to do so if I have a \nlarge team team (more than 6 members).  The only alternative to that \nis increase the initial amount of gold/silver in the 1st few scenarios \nto help you hire out team.\n\nSpecific issues like what to put in a scenario should be discussed \nwhen/if we start the 50 Project.\n\n\n"}}
