I would like to be able to buy Golems and\n&gt; Giant Skeletons.  This might seem ridiculious, but how about a set of\n&gt; character classes that can surive in water?  That seem limiting, but\n&gt; currently, only 2 current characters classes can go over water.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Ricky Der&quot; &lt;TheLegendaryLight@w...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;    Hmmm, A new class?  How Bout a Mimic? those are cool, pluse we\n&gt; should\n&gt; &gt; have other classes like bards or Enchanters hehehe\n&gt; hmm.  We already have mages so we do not need enchanters.  How a\n&gt; character class that is a cross between a Cleric and a Mage?\n&gt;\n&gt; I would love to see the Archer be able to shoot a poison arrow.  It\n&gt; would continiously take off 2-5 health points every second.  Also, a\n&gt; barrage of exploding arrows would be a nice addition to the arsenal\n&gt; of\n&gt; an Archer.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
