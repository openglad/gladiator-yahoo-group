THAT WAS WHY I LIKED GLADI=\r\nATOR SO MUCH!  I like \n&gt; creating levels; you should&#39;ve seen me on ZZT.  I =\r\nwas limited \n&gt; by a tiny hard drive on my old  computer; I&#39;d love to use it=\r\n \n&gt; on a 160GB one.  I could make BILLIONS of  maps!  But why \n&gt; won&#39;t the =\r\nscenario editor work!?  WHAT FORCES CONSPIRE  TO \n&gt; KILL MY FUN!!?  I&#39;m oka=\r\ny.. I&#39;m okay.. *sniff*\n&gt; \n&gt; I love creating maps, too.  Especially maps tha=\r\nt try out new \n&gt; ideas like I did with my &quot;Weakest Link&quot; scenarios (#137 an=\r\nd \n&gt; #151).  My favorite map is, of course, &quot;The Large Army&quot; \n&gt; (#161).  It=\r\n has the elements I like best: one on one battles \n&gt; along with taking a la=\r\nrge number of opponents at once.  \n&gt; Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t plot a reall=\r\ny good thread to my scenarios.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------ Yahoo!
