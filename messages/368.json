Depending on how much memory the coder \nwanted to take up with each value, there are a set number of memory \nlocations where the value sits. If it grows larger than the space allocated \nfor it, the overflow is discarded.... or if it intrudes on another value, \nperhaps one used to run Glad.exe or Windows, you get a nice crash. To make \nthings worse, at one end of your little rented space in memory there&#39;s a bit \nwhich tells the computer whether the number is positive or negative. If the \nvalue gets too high, it overflows into this area and you usually get a \nnegative. That&#39;s what I assume happened to our archmages.\n     One thing that I&#39;m not quite sure on--which of your levels are so \ndifficult? I can beat any of the ones you posted with a character below \nlevel 75. (Of course, the experience gained on the level usually puts me \nabove 100.) I think that perhaps you should be steering yourself away from \nthe this-is-a-job-for-SuperMage(TM) scenarios and make something with a more \nuniversal appeal.\n     As for the rocks--I&#39;ve had very large areas filled almost completely \nwith those rocks that never vanish, and unless you&#39;re a cleric, blob, or \norc, you can clear them out in a few minutes. Try an archer&#39;s barrage, or \njust blast away with a mage or archmage. Those rocks will vanish.\n     I&#39;m still having problems with chain lightning. Used correctly, without \npushing any limits, it still brings my computer to a crawl. It&#39;s a nice \nchance to go get a drink, but it disrupts the role-playing realism. A lot. I \ndon&#39;t know how it&#39;s coded, but it may be that there are some unnecessary \ncalculations being done, slowing everything up. Or... is there a C object \nfor each little bolt of lightning? Blech. There must be SOME way to make the \nlightning AI centralised... it&#39;s not my area of expertise so I won&#39;t try to \nfigure it out.
