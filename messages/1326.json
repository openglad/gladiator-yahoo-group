The biggest form of cheating I use to reach \nthose high experience levels is by giving characters extra health and \nmana during a scenario.  Typically, I&#39;ll run out of energy using the \nmost powerfull attack available and need lots more to continue the \nfight.\n\nI do have a theory about experience levels and how to potentially \nhandle them, but that&#39;s a topic for another week.\n\nIf you are going for a really high experience levels, you&#39;ll have to \nkeep your constitution levels low to protect you from faeries and keep \nyour dexiteriority levels low (at least until a new release fixes that \nproblem) so that you can still use teleporters.  In addition, you&#39;ll \nneed to watch your intelligence levels and armor levels to keep from \ncrashing the game.  I am pretty convinced I have almost completely \nexplored the limits of having a team composed of a single extremely \nhigh experienced level character.\n\n\n"}}
