Tom probably got the message, as he is a moderator on the list.\n\nIf we get more messages tonight and tomorrow, January 2001 will have the\nmost messages of any month since the list started in September 1998.  Just a\nlittle statistic I thought you all might like to know.  I, personally, think\nit&#39;s amazing that there are so many messages going through the list,\nconsidering there are less than 70 subscribers and Gladiator is a relatively\nold game that hasn&#39;t had any recent developments.  Congrats, Tom & Forgotten\nSages team.\n\n\n"}}
