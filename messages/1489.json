Major issues: sound and ai.\n\nBTW, the source is written to compile under Linux using g++ as the\ncompiler. It hasn&#39;t been tested (at least not to my knowledge) under any\nother platform or compiler. The BSDs should work, but Windows is probably\na far stretch. If someone wants to install SDL and g++ for windows and\ngive it a try, let me know how it turns out. If someone has trouble\ngetting it to compile under Linux, (other than the sound issues), submit a\nbug report.\n\nI think I said this a few days ago, but everything works great except for\nsound, some ai, and joystick. Other than that, there shouldn&#39;t be any\nproblems.\n\nThis _is_ and open source project, so don&#39;t hesitate to submit patches if\nyou fix something. And just for clarification: the 0.1 release isn&#39;t the\nlatest. In fact, it is very ancient. Click on the CVS link to get to the\nlatest.\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
