I said the Mage beat the Ocean by FREEZING TIME not by \nheartburst.  Of course, I do not get any points for beating the level \nthat way, but I did beat it.  Darn, my mega-archmage can not summon \nindestructible fire elementals over water.  I can understand not being \nable to summon images, but not summoning elementals is a different \nmatter.  I mean if I want to put my archmage&#39;s life in danger by \nsummoning a fire elemental of water, that is my business not the the \ndesigners of the game&#39;s business.  However, I think I can beat the \nocean by just waiting it out and avoiding getting hit by anybody \nbecause I have so much health power.\n\nOn the positive note, my levels are passing tests for not being too \ndifficult.  I make notes of the scenarios and things I changed from \nthe original and put that in a text file attached to the scenarios.  I \nwill continue on my plan to build more difficult levels.  Yes, I will \nbe cracking down on how many opponents you face, but beware: very few \nopponents = very high experience level opponents.  I will still stick \nto my plan of making very level potentially worth millions of special, \neven if it means I have to high level gold and silver to accomplish \nthis.  \n\nBTW, Tevildo, how did you like my placement of gold and silver in the \nthe &#39;hedge&#39; scenarios?\n\n\n"}}
