Would\n&gt;it be possible to see some of your source code (heh heh...not likely, eh?)\n&gt;or at least maybe direct me to somewhere I could learn more...It seems that\n&gt;all the graphic resources available online are way too advanced or only for\n&gt;specific compilers such as Microsoft Visual C++ which I don&#39;t have the\n&gt;pleasure of owning. (ahem)\n&gt;\n&gt;-Maxim\n\nBjorn (sorry, can&#39;t find the &quot;o&quot; with slash through it) already answered \nmost of the C/C++ issues .. but basically:\n\nGladiator was programmed in a mixture of C++ and 80x86 Assembly, using the \nWatcom C++ compiler.  Basically, we used C++ for most of the code, \nespecially object hierarchy, list management, AI routines, etc., and \nassembly for the fast graphics routines.  One of our members created a \nbasics graphics engine in assembly, which the rest of us then used for the \ngame.\n\nFor code sample .. I&#39;d actually be happy to share some of it, if you have \nany specific questions (ie, certain types of routines, or whatever).  Just \nlet me know.\n\nAs to helping out the FSGames team, there&#39;s not much you can do right now, \nI&#39;m afraid -- two of the team are working for Blizzard, and so they&#39;re \npretty much tied up 150% right now with Diablo 2.  I&#39;m working full time at \na &quot;normal&quot; job, and also working for the http://www.sluggy.com site, which \nalso takes a fair amount of time, so .. unless you have a nifty time \nmachine for us, or a way to squeeze more hours into a day, there&#39;s not much \nthat&#39;d help :)\n\nTake care,\n   Tom\n\n\n\n\n"}}
