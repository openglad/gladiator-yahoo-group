If I &#39;was&#39; a ghost, the\nfirst\n  thing I would scare is every enemy cleric before they turned me\nundead.  Given 100 level 3 elves and 100 level 1 faeries, it would be\neasier to take out the elves.  If you disagree, I can create one map\nwith the elves and use the same map and populate it with faeries and\nsee which one is harder to defeat.\n\nMages, Archmages, Clerics, and Druids are the only characters I would\nrank harder to beat than faeries.  I can take out all Skeletons and\nGhosts fairly easily with clerics.  Elves loose magic power when\ntraveling through trees, which implies a certain strategy to use when\ndealing with elves.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
