I have already finished 5\nnew ones.  I will start on #6 soon.  I think it oughta be a race  to\nsee who comes out with new good scenarios NEXT.  As I said before,\nthe\n  ones I am working on will NOT be easy and should be considered\n&#39;HARD&#39;\nat the easiest settings.  Creating new scenarios is NOT as easy as I\npreviously thought.\n\n--- In gladiator@egroups.com, &quot;Seth Mitchell&quot; &lt;smitchell@t...&gt; wrote:\n &gt; The poll has been fixed.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
