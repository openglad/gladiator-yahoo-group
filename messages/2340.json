I assume it has\n&gt; something t=\r\no do with graphics, but I have no idea on how to use it,\n&gt; and the manual m=\r\nakes no mention of it what so ever.\n\nThe function of the original editor.ex=\r\ne program was to create brand\nnew maps of any size and fill the maps relati=\r\nvely easily with tiles of\nthe same type.  Of course, if you know any progra=\r\nmming language that\ncan read/write binary files, you could accomplish the s=\r\name thing.  A\nfew years ago, I explained how do substitution of tiles\nprogr=\r\nammatically.  Really easy stuff if you understand file input/output.\n\n\n\n"}}
