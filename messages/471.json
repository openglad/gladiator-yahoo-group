I mean if I have multiple enemy teams the \nskeletons will invariably end up running into other teams before \ntaking on the player.  The only reason I put doors in &#39;The Brag&#39; was \nto achieve the effect of taking on a few opponents at a time.  This \nleads to another point:  I do not like to face millions of opponents \nall at once and then go chasing after the remaining few remaining.  \nThat is what makes &#39;Tic and Tac&#39; scenario so hard:  The crushing \nnumber of opponents all at once.\n\nThat is what I think succeeded in preventing with &#39;Archer Encampment&#39; \nfrom my own scenarios:  1 army to get you distracted while 4 other \narmies are approaching.\n\nIn general, in a good scenario, you do not fight half your opponents \nall at once.\n\n\n"}}
