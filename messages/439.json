However, after \nplaying it with my friend, we beat it WITH the faeries alive as a \ncondition, by having him make an ENEMY ghost and fear the heck out of \nthe faeries until they are stuck in a corner. Then I proceeded to own \nthe slimes with my Archer.\n\nJust a few questions for you all, though:\n\n1) Is the Archer&#39;s explosive arrow fire rate supposed to be THAT \nrediculous, or is it a bug?\n\n2) Why the heck did DPH create a level with (arbitrarily large \namount) of gold in it?\n\n3) I&#39;d like to see your unreleased scenarios, DPH... We&#39;ll see how \nthe Storm of Death prevails over them.\n\n(Tip of the Message : Planting a tree on someone&#39;s head hurts. A lot.)\n\n\n"}}
