Now: it was mentioned a \nwhile back that though the site link was fairly busted, the Beyond \nFreedom demo might be made available through FTP���&#39;� any news on\nthat? \nAnd I&#39;m just finishing up about fifty levels for the existing \nGladiator program���&#39;� should I package them up and post them\nsomewhere? \nDoes anyone else have levels sitting around? I know Shayd tried to \ngather some, but that was a while back���&#39;� Shayd, I&#39;ve already got \nBadlands, thanks--anything new? It wouldn&#39;t be too hard to take the \nexisting levels, Tryxian, my stuff, and whatever else I can find and \nslap it all together into a big 150+ level complex-would it be\nillegal or not-nice to alter a couple of the original levels to \nconnect with the new? Let me know, people���&#39;� One more thing:\nLight4700 \nsaid, &quot;If you would like some Gladiator stages you can download them \nhere if you like&quot; but didn&#39;t give an address���&#39;� Where were the\nstages?\nLight4700, are you still on the list? Darklord217 also said he had \nthree or so levels in the works and Tom claimed to have a smattering \nof random send-ins���&#39;� Kylekabob3 mentioned having a few levels,\nMaxim\ntoo���&#39;�  and of course there was the apocryphal &quot;guy&quot; who was\nworking on \nthe Worlds webpage, whom only Tom knew (this may or may not have been \nSlwright, who said he had 12-15 levels)���&#39;� If they&#39;re not finished\nand \nyou don&#39;t have the time, I&#39;d be perfectly willing to polish them\nup���&#39;� \nand I&#39;m very careful about viruses, so that&#39;s not an issue. Say, has \nDavid Chang (who made Tryxian) been up to anything lately? The\ncreator \nof Boost said (I think) that he would alter the code to meet the\nupdates���&#39;� has this been done? Little bits-Dave Hinkle/Jeff/whoever\nyou \nare���&#39;� do you still have your improved cleric graphic? And Tom���&#39;�\nare \nthere any levels that just weren&#39;t released for some reason? I&#39;m \nthinking of the fragmentary Level 61 that was packed in my levels.001 \nbut won&#39;t load���&#39;� about the Witch Cassandra and the Wasteland\nValley. \nAnd does anyone know what the heck DAYOFDRA.MOD is? Anyway, I hope to \nhear from all you folks, and I&#39;ll try my best to actually put out a \ncompilation. Regards,\n                       -Tevildo.\n\n\n\n"}}
