The \nmage stopped time long enough for the archmage to chain lightning the \ngenerators, at which point I allowed all but the archmage to die. The \narchmage summoned fifty fire elementals to destroy the remaining blobs. By \ndoing all this and grabbing the life shields from the dead party members, \nthe archmage leveled up to 136 instantly. From there, it was fairly easy to \nhave the archmage beat the extreme level using hit-and-run tactics \n(teleport, chain lightning the bonepile, teleport, heartburst the mage \ntower, etc.) and then repeat the thing with the fire elementals.\n\nI believe that it&#39;s more challenging and more entertaining to do larger \nmissions, with a real plot, rather than just bust stuff up and leave. Maybe \nyou&#39;d like to try making a full level with a map and stuff, rather than just \nbuilding on South of Talwood? It takes some experience to get fully \ncomfortable with Scen and Editor, but it&#39;s worth it. Talk to you later.\n                 -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\nShare information about yourself, create your own public profile at \nhttp://profiles.msn.com.\n\n\n"}}
