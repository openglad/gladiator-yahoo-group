(effectively sending the attack commands at the same instant.)\n\n\nArchers\n\nNew Attacks \n\nFreeze arrow- when enemy is hit with this arrow they take damage and \nare frozen for a certain period of time.\n(This could be bad, arrow after arrow, its like being in a crowd of faeries,\nmuch too frustrating, especially since archers can attack fairly fast (faster than faeries).\n\nEthereal Arrow- single arrow that travels through trees (and walls \nmaybe) and does damage when hits enemy.\n(Good, reasonable, maybe even goes through enemies, and can strike multiple targets,\nthe arrow would end at the edge of map, or after a long range, damage on these type of\narrows should be lowered considerably due to its special effects)\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"}}
