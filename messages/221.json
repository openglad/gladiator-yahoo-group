When I refer to\n&gt; &#39;normal&#39; trees, I mean trees that nobody can destory, you know the\n&gt; big, tall trees (not short druid-created trees).  If you can put the\n&gt; big, tall trees on the map, tell me how.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
