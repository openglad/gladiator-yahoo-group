I can&#39;t hardly wait\n&gt; to go through all scenarios.\n&gt;\n&gt; I noticed a few interesting things so far (so I cheated to get extra\n&gt; money to find these interesting things):\n&gt;\n&gt; Why does an archer run after being close to lots of exploding bolts\n&gt; exploding? I had an archer up to 400 on everything but experience and\n&gt; his experience level was 40. I was launching lots of exploding bolts\n&gt; close to a wall and he started to run away on his own.\n\nExplosions are the one thing that can hurt any member of your team,\nregardless of who set them off.  Thieves can hurt themselves with their\nown bombs if they&#39;re not careful, and accordingly, archers can hurt\nthemselves with their own exploding arrows.  Running away from an\nexplosion is the same reaction an enemy gets -- so you&#39;ll have to be\ncareful where you let those exploding bolts go off!\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, I had slime upto 180 on everything but experience (experience\n&gt; level was 20). When I left a scenario I had only 15 team members of\n&gt; my\n&gt;  team, most were slime), I got ready to purchase another team member\n&gt; and I couldn&#39;t. I checked the view of my team and behold, the number\n&gt; of slimes had surpassed 30!!\n\nI guess slimes could be described as the brute force of a team.  If you\nwant to take out an enemy with sheer numbers as opposed to quality\ncharacters, then you can hire some slimes the level before and let them\nspend their time multiplying.  I don&#39;t usually use slimes because of the\nway they divide, however, and how weak they are against some of the\nmore skilled opponents you&#39;ll encounter.\n\n&gt; Who can do the most damage in a single attack to a character: archer,\n&gt; cleric, mage, archmage, fire elemental, or druid?\n\nNot reading up on the classes, I think it would have to be fire elemental.\nThen I would assume archer, since they are the most warrior-like class,\nand then druid, cleric, mage, archmage (archmages get even worse\nbare-hand-damage than mages!).  You can check this out on your score\nmenu by examining damage/hit -- though each character of a similar\nclass does a different damage/hit, even if the stats are the same.\n\n&gt; I have a suggest new power for ghost: Possession. A ghost could\n&gt; possess the body of an ally or friend for a limited period of time\n&gt; and use the attacks of the possessed.  While the ghost is possessing,\n&gt;  all damage is inflicted upon the body of the possessed.  If the\n&gt; ghost\n&gt;  is possessing a druid, all faeries produced are on the side of the\n&gt; ghost.  If the ghost is possessing a cleric, all ghosts and skeletons\n&gt; produced are on the side of the ghost or the ghost could use the\n&gt; cleric&#39;s resurrection ability to create a new body (of character type\n&gt; chosen by the ghost) for the ghost.\n\nKind of like the mage&#39;s hypnosis and the thief&#39;s charm, only the ghost\nis temporarily removed from the battlefield?  It would have to be\nfairly high-level--consider a ghost on the opposing team taking one of\nyour &quot;giant&quot; characters.\n\n-Chirs\n\n\n"}}
