The whole \npurpose \n&gt; of the Garden was making you WORK for that information. Happy \nhunting.\n\nOk, I can buy that.  Last time I went through the tevfifty I missed \nthe Garden of Golden Apples.\n\nThe \n&gt; most important thing, I think is to keep the levels unique and \nvaried. I \n&gt; know I had a lot of narrow passages in TevFifty, but there were also \na lot \n&gt; of open battlefields for the melee-lovers out there. And I don&#39;t \nknow of \n&gt; anyone else who&#39;s used a floating staircase as the setting for a \nbattle...\n\nJust wait until I get around to making &#39;The Weakest Link&#39;.  Remember \nthe strength of a chain is determined by it&#39;s weakest link so you can \nguess what that scenario&#39;s looks will be.  It will have a couple of \nnear duplicates.  \n\nI have converted one of my scenarios into a pre-quel for &#39;The Brag&#39;.  \nThe title of the pre-quel is &#39;The Inheritance&#39; and you can probably \nguess which scenario got converted.\n\nBack to what makes a good scenario:\n\nNavigatible - If you have lots of doors and lots of keys, there should \n be some pattern to keep the player from getting frustrated.  If you \nhave lots of teleporters, there should be a pattern to where they go \njust to help the player out.\n\nSpeaking of teleporters, I would request a revision to how teleporters \nwork: ability to press some key to teleport when on top of a \nteleporter.  I have got frustrated at times trying to get the \nteleporter to work with some of my faster characters.  Anyone else \nwith problems with teleporters?\n\nIn case y&#39;all are wondering, I have been promoted to group moderator \nand I am trying to keep messages flowing daily.\n\n\n"}}
