I believe\n&gt; hotmail has something similar.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; so if someone could just sum up everything important I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; missed that be helpful.\n&gt; If I missed anything someone else will fill the gaps :)\n&gt;\n&gt; Cya,\n&gt; Deathifier\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
