I know of at least \none new proposed character class for this category (Alchemist).\n\nTopics for the weeks following that are as follows:\n\n1)orc captains\n\n2)more proposed new character class - promotions of existing classes  \nonly - each proposed new character gets 3 days before I move on unless \n discussion picks up. I know of at least 3 proposed new promoted   \ncharacter classes for this category (high priest, asassin, practical  \nmage).\n\n3)Game Issues of Health, Potions of Magic, and Mana - yep, we will be \ntalking about health and mana of characters for a week. Somehow, it   \nwill be tied to Hybrid/dual class discussion.\n\n4)3 weeks on hybrid/dual class - we&#39;ll just have to wait and see why I \n want to handle this in 3 parts.\n\n5)Game Issues of Potion of Speed, Speed, and Teleporters\n\n6)Game Issues of Generators\n\n7)Game Issues of Experience Points & Experience Levels\n\n8)Game Issues of Basic Intelligence for characters\n\nI am working on putting together a Scenario Trivia contest to test \nknowledge of all scenarios on the website, but I haven&#39;t decided the \nprize(s) yet.\n\n\n"}}
