What I am talking \nabout is the mage&#39;s attacks.  I can kill an opponent with less energy \nusing the basic basic than either &quot;Energy wave&quot; or &quot;Heartburst&quot;.  Has \nanyone else noticed that?\n\nScenarios - I&#39;m working on &quot;The Tunneled Labryinth&quot;.  Don&#39;t worry, I \nplan on it taking about 30 minutes for a player to beat it, assuming \nthe player does not get lost.  It will be a teleporter maze with \ntowers as opponents.  [Interestinly enough, I hated walking around in \nmazes while playing Doom.]  Then I will try to work on scenarios in my \nset that I just don&#39;t have the inspiration for.\n\n\n"}}
