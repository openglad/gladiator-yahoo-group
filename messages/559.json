My mega-archmage has summoned elves that could stay in a\nforest and launch their most powerfull attacks without running out of\nmagical energy.  Admittedly, that is advantageous, but trick shouldn&#39;t\nbe.  The fire elementals summoned by my mega-archmage will never be\nable to run out of magical energy.  I forgot how high experience level\nyou have to give a Golem for him not to run out of magical energy.  I\nwould propose making the amount energy available for an attack related\nto the total max magical energy use available.  Effectively, this\nwould make attacks stronger.\n\nThis brings me to another point:  if a summoned image/firre elemental\nshould exceed max limits for magical energy and/or health, the value\ndisplayed should be the max limit.\n\nI do have a proposed new attack for a fire elemental: suicide.  The\nfire elemental could convert all of its health and magical energy into\none super-powerfull starburst or all at a single direction, with\nflames continiung until all the energy is absorbed.  Suicide would\nonly be available at experience level 4 or higher.  Use of this attack\nwould have to be approved by the player for non-summoned fire\nelementals [Suicide would NOT drain health from an archmage if a\nsummoned fire elemental decided to].  The fire elemental could request\npermission only once a minute.\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
