It might be the explosions and\nsplash damage CL causes that&#39;s\n&gt; slowing down the system.\n\nPossibly, it depends on how those effects are calculated and when they are\ncalculated.\nDamage application should be straightforward (but if it&#39;s area damage it\ncould be expensive, possibly another n for searching through all characters\nto apply damage to) and the random run function should be low cost (pick\ndirection, run that way) and the explosions should be very low cost\n(explosion occured here, draw me).\n\nSo in the worst case, and without knowing anything about how it works, you\ncould be looking at n^3 cost, quite a bit worse but still not game-stopping.\n\n&gt; this could be tested with a thief bombing 60 people; fleeing would be the\nsame, in this case... if the system slows down, then it&#39;s a fault in the\n&quot;flee from explosions&quot; function. if it doesn&#39;t, then it&#39;s a problem in the\nCL target-selection function.\n&gt;\n\nThat would be interesting, can you place bombs in scenarios that go off (I\nnoticed a while ago that funny errors were being reported and the cause was\na rouge boomerang that was placed on it&#39;s own into the scenario)?\nIf you can maybe someone could produce a testing scenario, however I still\nbelieve that each explosion would only be at worst cost n since it just goes\nthrough every character checking if damage should be applied and they should\nrun somewhere.\n\nHmm, interesting how a programming discussion on running costs has turned\nup, before it was scenario makers and now it&#39;s the programmers :)\nThis scenario editor will be a really interesting project, just as soon as\nmy exams finish :)\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
