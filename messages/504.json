I only say that to let you all know that\n&gt; having a tournament would be weeks away, at best.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first issue of the tournament would be what scenarios to use.\n&gt; Would we want to use the the built-in scenarios or create a special\n&gt; set of scenarios to use for the tournament?  If it is the later, it\n&gt; would probably be until both Tevildo [I&#39;m assuming you would want to\n&gt; help design those scenarios] and I have finished work on our own\n&gt; scenarios.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
