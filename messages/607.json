Well, I\nbelieve some people are working on that.  Part 2 was about existing\ncharacters.  This part will be about adding new characters.\n\nMore generators:  Specifically, a Faerie generator.\n\nDefinitely another class of Mages: Practical Mage.  When the mage\nreaches the point of choosing to become an Archmage, it can also\nchoose to become a Practical Mage.  Yea, it has the basic attacks plus\nteleportation and ability to create a teleporter marker.  2nd attack,\nteleport teammates.  Alternate: Teleport opponents.  3rd attack,\ncreate teleporter,  This would require an existing teleport marker.\nNote: all teleporters created by a Practical Mage are linked.\nAternate to teleporters:  Black hole.  Walking in it kills friends and\nfoes alike.  Size and duration is determined by stats on Practical\nMage.  Freeze time is 4th attack.  Just a carry over from Mage&#39;s\nattacks.  Alternate: Slow down time.  Watch as your teammates are able\nto move twice as fast as your opponents.  Magic is regenerated at\nnormal time.\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
