He/she will\ninitially have an experience level 100 and then will jump to\nexperience level 200.  I will be pitting this person against an evil\narchmage (who needs a name) who is experience level 150-175.  I just\nhope no person goes through that scenario (with the archmage) with a\nlarge army or game crashes might occur.\n\nTo balance out the scales, I plan on leaving blood spots around as\nwell tents and bonepiles.\n\nBy the way, I have finished all scenarios up to #159 of my set.  6\nmore scenarios to go!!  I never plan on trying to complete another set\nof scenarios by myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_,.-~=&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=~-.,_\n���`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`�������`����,��,����`����,�\n-Terry\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________\nMSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos: \nhttp://photos.msn.com/support/worldwide.aspx\n\n\n"}}
