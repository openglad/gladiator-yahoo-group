How do I fix it?\n- Note: When I was installing it using winrar, it says that there\nwere errors on the files.\n\n2) Besides the Yahoo Groups, is there a website for this group?\n\nSuggestions:\n1) Is it possible to play Gladiators on Multiplayer?\n\n2) Wouldn&#39;t it be fun if someone (or a group of people) made\nGladiators into an MMORPG? Where you can be one class and keep\ngaining levels / etc by doing various quests and killing monsters.\nYou would be able to gain items, gold, weapons/armor, spells,\ntechniques, etc.. and be able to play with your friends online!\n- Note: I have more ideas XD\n- Note: If it becomes an MMORPG, I might be able to help on the\ngraphics (monsters, weapons, etc). Maybe the music composition too!\n\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/\n\n\n\n\n"}}
