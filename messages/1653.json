Hypothetically, you could keep time frozen until \nyou \n&gt; wipe out the entire enemy force, as long as you have sufficient \nmana. \n&gt;  It gets aggrevating if a friendly mage keeps freezing time when \nthe \n&gt; rest of your team is out of mana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Heartburst is a very effective attack against 1-5 people.  If it \n&gt; effects more people, all you are doing is causing is chaos among \nenemy \n&gt; ranks.  Side note: Using heartburst attack against slime has caused \n&gt; the slime to grow, making heartburst not an effective attack \nagainst \n&gt; strong slime.\n&gt; \n&gt; Barbarians really do need more attacks.\n\n\nMages\nExtremely too powerful because mana can be gained so quickly and used \nin powerful moves such as freeze time and heartburst. \nBut they are balanced enough, if there was a move that reduced there \nmana. \n\nThey have enough moves as is, but there could be some potential shift-\nmoves. \n\nBarbarian\nBarbarians should have a move that reduces mana from surronding \nenemies, like War Cry. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
