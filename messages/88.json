That way the\n &gt; overseer/s could determine if the stats the players have a actually\n &gt; possible to obtain.\n &gt; \n &gt; Cya&#39;s,\n &gt; David Storey\n &gt; \n\nThat&#39;s actually what I was planning to do, with the save files--it&#39;s great \nthat you&#39;ll participate! :)  There will probably have to be some sort of\ninstructions on identifying which save file is yours on the home page, but\nthat shouldn&#39;t be too much of a problem to explain.\n\n &gt; \n &gt; &gt;From: maxim@... (Ape)\n &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt;&gt;From: &quot;Seth Mitchell&quot; &lt;smitchell@...&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I&#39;m thinking it would be cool if we got some kind\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; of Gladiator tournament going on.  I&#39;ve written\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; out a basic outline of how the rules would work\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; on my own, and would be happy to organize it, but\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I need to know if anyone would participate.\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt;&gt;The only problem is that multiplayer Gladiator still is not possible\n &gt; &gt;&gt;unless it is on the same computer.  This means that only singler-\n &gt; &gt;&gt;player touraments are possible.  The problem with that is that\n &gt; &gt;&gt;people can cheat in single player mode.\n &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt;Well...as long as we had no prizes or anything I don&#39;t think cheating\n &gt; would\n &gt; &gt;be a problem...I mean would be the motivation to cheat for something\n &gt; like\n &gt; &gt;this? I think it would be fun, and if no one cheated it would be\n &gt; interesting\n &gt; &gt;to see the results.\n &gt; &gt;-Maxim\n &gt; &gt;\n\nYeah, if any over the people looking over the save files see something\noutrageous like a level 50 warrior with 200 stats, we&#39;ll know something&#39;s\namiss.\n\n &gt; &gt;\n\nI can get to work on a level or two, but if anyone out there would like\nto give me a hand making some, I&#39;d be much obliged.\n\n-chris\n\n______________________________________________________\nGet your free web-based email at http://www.xoom.com\nSPECIAL OFFER:  250 Web Site Templates, Only $29.95! -\nhttp://orders.xoom.com/email\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
