The whole purpose \nof the Garden was making you WORK for that information. Happy hunting.\n\nAs to what makes a good scenario... I like a good story, preferably \nextending over several levels. I also like good natural-looking terrain as \nopposed to a bunch of square rooms or a flat featureless meadow. A good \nbalance between gold and enemies is always nice, as is a nice selection of \npotions strategically located on the map. A few named bosses are good, as \nlong as it isn&#39;t all &quot;Bigguyone&quot; and &quot;Bigguytwo&quot;. Some care should be taken \nto create realistic armies, such as having orc commanders command orcs, and \nhaving a few nasty mages in charge of a squad of golems and elementals. The \nmost important thing, I think is to keep the levels unique and varied. I \nknow I had a lot of narrow passages in TevFifty, but there were also a lot \nof open battlefields for the melee-lovers out there. And I don&#39;t know of \nanyone else who&#39;s used a floating staircase as the setting for a battle...\n     -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
