I figured i can work on them during school on my laptop while i&#39;m not busy. I&#39;ve been busy at home playing EverQuest so it kinda hard for me to focus.  but i have a prob determining what difficulty of scenarios i should build.  my last one was kinda bugged and unless someone would like to take a look at the scenarios i had for that to maybe fix it they are more then welcome, but my main problem is how hard should i make the new one, i understand you all have incredibly powered groups (well most of you), so how can i make it difficult? i need to know stats on your partys or groups so i can determine the average amonut of difficulty possible.\n\n\n                                                            Thanks for your Time,\n                                                              Ricky Der (The Legendary Light)\n\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]\n\n\n"}}
