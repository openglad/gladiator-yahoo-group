As you may know, Gladiator originally intended to\nhave six =\r\nspecial abilities for every class, but, of course, that never\nhappened.(The=\r\n only class with six abilities is the mage.) So, I just\nwanted to ask what =\r\nwould be some of your ideas for special abilities\non the classes?\n\nOne I th=\r\nought of that they sort of did, most likely by error, is\nexploding fire arr=\r\nows for the archer. Anyways, just wanted to hear\nyour ideas.\n\n\n"}}
