If you are working on anything in particular, \nwould it be possible to work making a way to export Gladiator maps to \na graphics format?\n\n\nNote, I have been playing around with my program making it move items \non the map.  I almost had &quot;The Brag&quot; reworked until I discovered I \nsomehow corrupted the scenario file.  Damn it, I had to start all over \n fixing the location of objects.  When I do get done with that part, \nI&#39;ll post my code for all the manipulation I did to adjust &quot;The Brag&quot; \nto its new map.  Hopefully, the map should be agreeable with more \npeople.  I, also, am going to slip in a topic sometime about \nexplosions before we hit the Scenario Trivia Contest week.\n\n\nAs soon as I get through fixing my maps, I am going to start working \non adding a sort feature to my program.\n\nSo far the sort I am thinking about is the following:\n\n1)Team Number (except for Weapons, Treasure, and FX orders)\n2)Startup Player Position for that team (if Applicable)\n3)Living Families\n4)Generator Families\n5)Doors for that team\n6)Treasures, Weapons, and FX orders sorted by Order number then Family \nnumber\n\n\n"}}
