I&#39;ve\n&gt; visited the official page at http://www.fsgames.com\n&gt; and I&#39;ve visited http://plaza.v-wave.com/shayd/\n&gt; It seems that nothing&#39;s happenning any more though...\n&gt; (1) When is Gladiator: Beyond Freedom coming out?\n&gt; (2) Is there a demo out there for Beyond Freedom?\n&gt; (3) Are there any other sites/links I can visit\n&gt; relating to Gladiator other than the ones mentioned\n&gt; above?\n\nWell I have a gladiator page.  I havn&#39;t had much time to work on it since I\nput it up so it&#39;s probly pretty crustified by now but maybe it will be of\nsome use to someone.  It&#39;s located at\nhttp://www.xyz.net/~viking/Gladiator.html\n\nugh, I just looked at it and I donno what I was thinkin with that background\ncolor but oh well.\n\n\n&gt; (4) Is the FSGAMES group still developing games?\n&gt; Anyways, I&#39;d just like to send out a hello to\n&gt; everyone on this list and compliment the programmers\n&gt; on a game well-made.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
