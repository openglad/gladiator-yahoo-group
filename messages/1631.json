Though I do have a couple of purposes for posting.\n\nFirst one being that there seems to be a glitch in OpenGlad 0.97 \nWin32 where if you try to backtrack levels the game crashes.  Though \nit seems to be fine if you just use the Setlevel command from the \nmenu to a previously played level.  If anyone wants/needs more info \non this I&#39;ll recreate the error and give more specifics.\n\nAlso, I downloaded the Gladiator: BF alpha from here, but I can&#39;t \nget it to run under Win XP Pro.  It&#39;ll run up to the point that you \nhit &quot;Go,&quot; albeit running with a seriously wrong palette.  If anyone \nhas gotten it to run under XP before, please mail me.\n\nThanks for any help.\n\n  - David\n\n\n\n"}}
