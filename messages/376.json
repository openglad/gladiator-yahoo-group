I figured I would post even \nif\n&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t own the registered game.  I know this game is awesome and \nI\n&gt; &gt;like it alot, but I am hesitant at paying 10 dollars(as small as \nthe\n&gt; &gt;amount may seem) for anything whose development is halted.  Please \ndo\n&gt; &gt;not respond and assume this is some kind of a plea for a password,\n&gt; &gt;this is just my opinoun.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hiya! (Figured I&#39;d send this to the list as well)\n\nTechnically work on the game has halted.  The only work being done is \npeople like Tevildo and myself making new scenarios to play.\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The lack of having G:BF out there is definitely my fault -- people \nhave \n&gt; been asking for it for many months, but between hard drive crashes, \nmy \n&gt; day-job, and lots of other little things, I haven&#39;t had a chance to \nget it \n&gt; re-posted recently :(\n&gt; \n&gt; I do have an out-of-date version here on my hard drive -- it doesn&#39;t \nhave \n&gt; the fixes/features of the more recent versions, but I suppose it&#39;s \nbetter \n&gt; than nothing.  The file is about 18 megs in size, I think -- here, \nI&#39;ll put \n&gt; a link to it at:\n&gt;          http://24.2.87.94/GladAlpha.zip\n&gt; \n\nOk, one quick question.  Will the same scenario editor for Gladiator \nwork for G:BF?  If so, what scenario numbers will be open?  Can anyone \nof us registered users create some scenarios that will be pre-included \n in the G:BF?  If so, I might be willing to work on some &#39;normal&#39; \nscenarios for the future game.\n\n\n"}}
