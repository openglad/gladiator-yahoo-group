Druids can summon the \nfaeries that \n&gt; &gt;are the achilles heal of mages/archmages. Thieves can turn\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;invisible and keep attacking you, making them worthy opponents.\n&gt; \n&gt; ok but the computer doesn&#39;t use these steatigys enoughto make them \nwouth \n&gt; mentioning. if you play player vs. player they might\n&gt; be even but in player vs. computer the 1st/2nt tear charecters have \ni heuge \n&gt; advantage\n\nAt experience level 12 and higher, thieves do have this tendacy to \nstay invisible and attack you.  It can be annoying finding invisible \nthieves when you have frozen time.  They stay invisible for the entire \nduration [which I don&#39;t want to change; in a certain one of the \ntevfifty, I kept my mega-thief invisible just to keep him safe when \ntime is frozen.] so I resorted to waiting for time to become NORMAL.\n\n\n"}}
