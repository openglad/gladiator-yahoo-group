The alchemist and the mimic are kind of off the wall. \nHere&#39;s my idea(s).\n\nThere should be more elementals:\n\nWater Elemental (maybe summonable by someone/Druid?)\nShoots a burst of high velocity water as basic attack. (limited range)\nLightning: A bolt of lightning like the druid bolt, but much stronger \nand slightly bigger.\n(Elemental would be able to freely move over water)\n\nEarth Elemental (kind of muddy looking fella)\nBasic attack would be a punch.\nMudd Ball: A Gob of mud thrown from the elemental that paralyzes and \nhurts the victim.\n(Elemental would heal 2x as fast as regular healing happens)\n\nI can&#39;t really think of a good air elemental use because there is \nalready faries and ghosts.\n\n\n--- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower&quot; \n&lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Are there any name character classes you would like to add to the \ngame \n&gt; that aren&#39;t promotions of an existing characters or hybrids/dual \n&gt; class?  If so, this is your week to discuss those ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll start with a brand one:\n&gt; \n&gt; gargoyle character class\n&gt; basic attack - claw a character in front of it or tail whip a \n&gt; character behind it\n&gt; special attacks\n&gt; 1)glide - this allows the character to glide short distances over \n&gt; trees and water (basic attack won&#39;t work while gliding for obvious \n&gt; reasons)\n&gt; 2)hibernate - this allows the character to turn to stone for \nhealing. \n&gt;  During this process of healing, 95% of the damage from any attack \non \n&gt; the character is automatically deflected while mana is used to \nrestore \n&gt; health.  Hibernation ends either after all mana is exhausted or the \n&gt; character is in full health.\n&gt; \n&gt; It&#39;s ok to disagree with the moderator.\n\n\n"}}
