The special ended up in the millions.  I estimate it\n&gt; will take at least a level 50 archmage and a couple of level 40\n&gt; clerics to be able to win.\n&gt;\n&gt; To that end, I will be designing levels that give lots of experience\n&gt; and at least $1,000,000 in treasure.\n&gt;\n&gt; If we are going to have so many levels, should not somebody try to\n&gt; tie\n&gt; them together in as few zip files as possible?\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
