Special ability: duplicate anybody\n  else&#39;s special attack.\n\n  alchemist: special abilities: create the various potions used in the\n  game, except for the potion of mana [that would be kind of whacky\n  using x amount of mana to create a potion of mana that gives x+ amount\n  of mana].\n\n  Your use of Yahoo!
