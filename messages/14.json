I think it&#39;s fixed now, so I should\nbe able to be an *active* official FSGames rep again :&gt;\n\nIn terms of problems saving scenarios -- has that been solved yet? Usually,\nthe\nproblems occur when trying to *SAVE* a scenario rather than load one, but it\nsounds like that&#39;s not the case here.\n\nOffhand, all I can think of is that you&#39;ve tried to make a level that already\nexists in the &quot;pack&quot; file (graphics.001, levels.001), and so the game loads\nthe\ndefault level instead.  Otherwise .. can anyone report any details on this for\nme to track down? For example, when you try to load a level, do you get:\n        * &quot;Invalid level&quot; message\n        * Wrong level loads\n        * Game crashes\n        * or what?\n\nAlso, for Max -- don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t be upset if you &#39;usurp&#39; our position\nand\nfind solutions for people :&gt;  Believe me, we&#39;re very happy to have users who\ncan help figure these things out, so feel free to diagnose to your heart&#39;s\nconent!\n\nTake care,\n  Tom\n\n \n\n---------------------------- \nTom Ricket \n&lt;mailto:tricket@...&gt;mailto:tricket@... \nForgotten Sages Games \n&lt;http://www.fsgames.com&gt;http://www.fsgames.com \n---------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n"}}
