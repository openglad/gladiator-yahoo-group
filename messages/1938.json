What I did was start a new game with just a cleric and play through the entire demo with just that cleric.  For each map I&#39;d kill some critters with the mystic mace ability and raise up an army of skeletons and let them do my fighting.  When I&#39;d finally get to the please register level my cleric would be strong enough to kill one or two of the enemy and get skeletons to going... and the next thing you would know there would just be bodies lying around and an army of skeletons running helter skelter.\n\n"}}
