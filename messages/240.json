Darn, I had to use \nBattle (not Slaughter) level against the next to last scenario. Then, \nI finally beat my own extreme level with a team.\n\nI am going to show the stats before the team won in the same\nalignment \nas it is when you view the team:  Most of the illegitimate part was \nraising money to boost up the stats on the mage.\ncleric1    230  230  230  410  230  39\ncleric2    230  230  230  410  230  41\narchmage   253  253  253  410  253  50\nmage       290  290  290  480  290  42\n\nfinal stats:  the archmage (summoned all the fire elementals) ended\nup \nat experience level 72 and cleric1 (summoned most of the undead)\nended \nup at experience level 44.  I ended up with roughly 3 million dollars.\n\nI kept getting an error message about Weapon 44 when running my \nscenario.  Can anybody from FSGames tell me what that error message \nconcerns?  I want the scenario to run without error messages.\n\nNow, I will start working on my own levels.  Beware, everyone of the \nscenarios will be tough.\n\nBTW, Moderator, may I upload the zipped version of my scenarios (when \nI am finished) to the files section of this egroup?\n\n\n"}}
