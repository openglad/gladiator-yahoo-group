I transformed on my own an \nOthello program in QBasic without subroutines into a very workable and \neasily expandable program.  I was working on a program to use Visual \nBasic as a GUI and C as my intelligence for Othello, but my old PC \ncouldn&#39;t support it and my copy of Visual Studio on CD has bad files \non it.  I am currently working on acquiring all of Visual Studio to \ninstall on this PC so I can complete a program I started.  \n\nThe easiest way to make a new scenario mouse-oriented would be use \nVisual Basic or Visual C/C++, IMHO.\n\nI would like a show of hands of those who would like to work on a \nscenario editor.  Please include some hints of qualifications.\n\n\n"}}
