Oops, the tournament group wasn&#39;t specific enough.  We&#39;ll bring \nthat point up in a discussion.  No violation recorded.  BTW, if the \nonly thing I would do if someone violated conditions is just \nadjust an individual member&#39;s profile to require his/her posts to get \nmoderator approval.  I&#39;m counting on not having to do that.\n\nJust to clarify things:\n\nSomething that would be a violation is: &quot;I would need more time to \ncomplete tournament scenarios so I am voting against that rule.&quot;\n\nMentioning (not discussing) things that were overlooked in the rules \nis OK.  I just don&#39;t want to see a debate about the merits of each \nindividual rule.  If anyone needs a rule clarified before voting, feel \nfree to ask for clarifications.\n\nBTW, I am also going to be recording email addresses who voted on the \nproposed rules.  This way I can start putting together a list of \npotential tournament players.\n\n\n"}}
