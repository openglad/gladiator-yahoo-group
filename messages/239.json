Although the &#39;Slime Machine&#39; scenario would be \ndifficult if I did not have a mage or achmage.  I should be playing \nscenario 398 or 399 today and sending my illegitimate team through \nsoon.\n\nActually, I put the generators there as a distraction.  Walking \nthrough the tevfifty gave me ideas on how to put together great\nlevels \n.  I plan on writing a file for scenarios, with some notes.  Any \nadvice on how to put together great scenarios would be welcome.\n\nSomeone may have spent a lot of time putting together &#39;the Tryx \nchronicles&#39;, but the time was not spent wisely.\n\nHmm.  May I suggest a feature to the game?  Make it where a player\ncan \nlook up what scenario numbers the person has been there with a given \nteam.  It gets hairy trying to keep track of which scenario numbers a \nplayer has been through.\n\n\n"}}
