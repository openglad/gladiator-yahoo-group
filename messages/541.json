Is this correct? (Um.. If I&#39;m wrong, then... \nuh... ignore this. ;))\n&gt; \n\nWell, that&#39;s technically correct... you have to start with some sort \nof .PIX file. But you can alter it any way you like. Scen.exe is \nlimited, in that you can&#39;t change scenario size, but Editor.exe has \nthat capability. It lets you change the dimensions any way you like. \n(How do you think I got those long, narrow &quot;Aqueduct&quot; levels?) You \ncan also mirror a map top-to-bottom or left-to-right, change all \ntiles of a particular type into another type, and do a few other \ntricks. I use it a lot, even though the interface is a little funny. \nCheck it out for yourself if you haven&#39;t already.\n     -T.\n\n\n"}}
