I&#39;ve tried to leave faerie dust on top of slimes \nin one scenario and the slimes acted like nothing ever touched them.  \nOn the other hand, if it could work, [scary thoughts about what I \ncould set up] . . .\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Hmm, interesting how a programming discussion on running costs has \nturned\n&gt; up, before it was scenario makers and now it&#39;s the programmers :)\n\nIt&#39;s only natural.\n\n&gt; This scenario editor will be a really interesting project, just as \nsoon as\n&gt; my exams finish :)\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n"}}
