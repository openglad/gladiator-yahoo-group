Well, I\n&gt; &gt; believe some people are working on that.  Part 2 was about existing\n&gt; &gt; characters.  This part will be about adding new characters.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; More generators:  Specifically, a Faerie generator.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Definitely another class of Mages: Practical Mage.  When the mage\n&gt; &gt; reaches the point of choosing to become an Archmage, it can also\n&gt; &gt; choose to become a Practical Mage.  Yea, it has the basic attacks plus\n&gt; &gt; teleportation and ability to create a teleporter marker.  2nd attack,\n&gt; &gt; teleport teammates.  Alternate: Teleport opponents.  3rd attack,\n&gt; &gt; create teleporter,  This would require an existing teleport marker.\n&gt; &gt; Note: all teleporters created by a Practical Mage are linked.\n&gt; &gt; Aternate to teleporters:  Black hole.  Walking in it kills friends and\n&gt; &gt; foes alike.  Size and duration is determined by stats on Practical\n&gt; &gt; Mage.  Freeze time is 4th attack.  Just a carry over from Mage&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; attacks.  Alternate: Slow down time.  Watch as your teammates are able\n&gt; &gt; to move twice as fast as your opponents.  Magic is regenerated at\n&gt; &gt; normal time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your use of Yahoo!
