Boomerang really wasn&#39;t that strong of an attack and\n&gt; neither is whirlwind for the amount of mana used.\n\nI have also found whirlwind not to be too useful. Usually when I&#39;m in a\nsituation that requires the use of whirlwind, I use charge to get out.\nHowever, boomerang is one of my favorite abilities. Its especially\npowerful when you can launch several at once and when you&#39;re fighting a\nbig crowd. It is kinda useless when you&#39;re trying to hit far away (only\nhits at like 40 degree intervals or something, so the farther away your\ntarget is, the less likely you are to hit it), but up close it can cause\nlots of pain. Boomerangs can also go through walls and trees, which is\nrather unrealistic/unfair but is a useful bug/feature.\n\n&gt; Elves are pretty cool, but at about level 30, they lose all their big\n&gt; weakness.  At level 30, hypothetically an elf could stay in the middle\n&gt; of a forest and continously attack opponents without the risk of being\n&gt; harmed because of mana production ability outweighs mana lost while\n&gt; staying in a forest.\n\nHmm... This could possibly be remedied by having an elf not regain mana\nwhile walking through trees, and making mana drain at a rate of a certain\npercent of total mana per second rather than a set number. Other than the\ntree walking, though, I find elves rather boring. All they have are\nvariations of rock abilities. One of these days, I will get unlazy and\nthink of some good abilities to sugest.\n\nHowever, having said all that, I think characters like elves (and\narchmages, although I guess that&#39;s for a later week) are too powerful at\nhigh (read: 100+) levels. I just played a scenario where all I did was\nmegarocks until they cleared everyone out. This goes for soldiers, too. At\nvery high levels they can just surround themselves with boomerangs and\ncharge through pretty much anything. All that can probably be remedied\nby giving a maximum amount of things a character can control at a time\n(ie, rocks, boomerangs, and other things like that).\n\nThere also seems to be a bug that makes some rocks stay infinitely in the\ngame. Its not really a discussion topic, but oh well :-)\n\n\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
