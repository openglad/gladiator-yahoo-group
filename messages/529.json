By requiring posting your team stats every 5 scenarios or so, I\n&gt; am hoping that the honor system will work and it will also encourage\n&gt; competition.\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as working on new scenarios, I am skipping ahead to work on a\n&gt; scenario very similiar to &#39;Weakest Link&#39; because I have finished work\n&gt; on it.  The teleporters are all lined up, kaing use of teleporters\n&gt; much easier, and I am able to beat this scenario at Slaughter with my\n&gt; mega Archmage without summoning images or fire elementals.  One man\n&gt; teams can beat this scenario if you apply a good strategy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
