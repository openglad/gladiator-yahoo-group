I have made over \n40,000,000 dollars in one level.  Here&#39;s how to do it :\n\nWhen your main character is pretty well-off\n\n1.  Hire a Slime.\n2.  Train the Slime so it has a lot of stuff (Intelligence and Armor \t  \n    are best)\n3.  Go to an empty level.\n4.  Let the Slime reproduce\n5.  Kill the reproductions\n6.  If a shield is left, take it, if not, try again.\n\nSometimes the Slimes will resurrect over their shields, and you get \nthe money.  I&#39;m not sure how it works, but sometimes when you \nexit the level, you dont keep any slimes.  I&#39;m not sure, but I think if \nyou DON&#39;T kill the starting slime, then you&#39;ll keep every slime you \nhave at the end of the level.  Then you can upgrade those, kill their \noffspring, and make a lot of money.  \n\n\n--\nSgMitchell\nsmitchell@...\n\n\n\n"}}
