I am willing to bet its \nthe same people for both polls.\n\nIf I work under the assumption that there might a lot more people \nwilling to participate in the tournament if the rules were published, \nI could proceed.\n\nNow, I arrive at a question: how do we proceed in making rules for the \ntournament?  Do we want a separate yahoo group to hash out the rules  \nin secret and then publish the rules once we finish or do we want to \ndiscuss possible rules in this group?\n\n\n"}}
