Protagonist of story, 5&quot;10, brown hair, facial beard. Uses quarterstaff, magic. In the group to thwart Jakarta.\n\nHightower - Barbarian AKA Big Tuff Guy. 6&quot;8, black hair in warrior pony tail, cleanshaven. Uses a large maul. In the group to fight people. \n\nBjorn - Thief AKA Sir Sneaks Alot. 5&quot;9, black hair, commoner&#39;s clothes, uses a long or short sword (havent decided). Yearns to be group leader. In the group to get money.\n\nTrahern/Zjackrum - Elf. 5&quot;5, gray hair, facial paint of some elf clan. Wears forest clothing, uses the mantray (special elf sword). Very agreeable and playful. In the group for the adventure.\n\nOwahn Khaat - Saervii guy in charge of recruitment.\n\nDeathifier - Cleric. 5&quot;10, blond hair (like the guy in glad) uses priest magic. Red robes of the God Ricket :D no weapon as of yet. Will join the group later on.\n\nTriad/Oldschool - Archer. You need to be something more though... Got any other weapon choice? Character description? Attitude? Why are you in the group?\n\nRory - Assassin. Ok... I assume you work for the Saervii too... Might stick you on the bad guy team if I can&#39;t fit you in... Now, as amazing as you want to be, if you&#39;re an assassin, you can&#39;t use magic. Sorry, just not happenin. Same thing with Triad, need a bit of character info.\n\nDancing Corpse - You&#39;d definately be on the bad guy&#39;s team as some kind of undead creature. Maybe like Morduno from Last Blade 1 (its a street fighter clone arcade game) I think I&#39;m pretty much on my own for making up stuff about this char... Definately going to be awhile before I bring you into the story.\n\nThe guy we meet at the start of Chapter 3 is Shifter, he works for Jakarta. Still need a couple of names for character I&#39;m planning on making. Bonus points if you dont mind dying, since people always need to die.\n\nAnd to Rory: Forgotten Realms made Baldur&#39;s gate, and using two weapons is strangely Drizzt like. He&#39;s a character in the books and the game.\n\n-Trahern/Zjackrum\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free! \r\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143 \r\n\r\n\n\n"}}
