Once the medium slime &quot;dies&quot;, \nthe new small slime has the health points of the new experience level. \n From there, you can use the slime as target practice for either \nthieves or archers to gain experience points.  Or you could turn the \nslime into an Archer and use the exploding bolt attack to nearly kill \nyourself.  Then bring your cleric nearby to start healing your wounded \n archer.  Repeat process until cleric gets to desired experience \nlevel.\n\n[Zardus, in OpenGlad, make sure to change things so you can *NOT* get \nexperience points while playing a level you already defeated.  Sorry, \nbut I view that as a problem.]\n\nAnother trick is for an elf to switch to &quot;bouncing rocks&quot; or more \npowerfull attack.  Then move the elf next to a solid wall and start \nfiring away.  The elf will actually gain mana in this manner.  It&#39;s a \nreally nice way to recharge mana in a hurry. :-)\n\nDo you guys know any other tricks in the game?\n\n\n"}}
