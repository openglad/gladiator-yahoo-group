Another possible power is &#39;take over&#39;.  A ghost takes over a \ncharacters body and turns the character&#39;s soul into another ghost.  \nThis power would require an extremely high power level. These two new \npowers would make people rethink the idea of having one character \npowerfull enough to take the rest of the characters out.\n\nWhat about giving a fire elemental the power to lanch multiple \nfireballs at a given target and the ability to launch a more \npowerfull fireball attack?\n\n\n"}}
