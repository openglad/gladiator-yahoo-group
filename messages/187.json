You summon a defense and your clerics run \naway to fight other enemies.  Then, a cleric yells for help.  Whose \nfault is it that the cleric dies?  Or another thing.  I summon a \ndefense, but my cleric insists on doing his own thing or worse yet, \nbecomes frozen stiff.  I swear clerics need to be re-programmed to be \nmore team players than individuals.  If enemy clerics would \nconsentrate on protecting others, I would swear I would never be able \nto win.\n\nI am trying to play through gladiator with 2 clerics and 2 mages.  \nI&#39;ll let one become an archmage.  Smaller teams mean everyone gets \nupgrades quicker but have problems taking on large numbers at a time. \n Larger teams means slower upgrades but fewer problems taking on\nlarge \nnumbers at a time.  When I finish through with 2 clerics and 2 mages, \nI may try a team of 2 clerics, 2 mages, and 2 elves.\n\nMy own problem with mages is that they frequently run out of magic \npower when engaging the enemy.  I really think that a mage should be \ntreated as a spy unless the mage has a super high power level.  \nSpeaking of which, is there a intelligence level high enough for a \nmage to continously teleport without running out of magic power?\n\nDoes anyone know how to use a thief effectively?  I discovered that \ntheives are usually more trouble than their worth because of a\ntendacy \nto create bombs if they are not busy.\n\nOne small question:  is anyone tried to make an RP out of characters \nfrom this game?\n\n\n"}}
