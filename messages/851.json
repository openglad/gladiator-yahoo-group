The size comes to a grand total of about 60k (big difference from\nbefore).\n\nThe documentation isn&#39;t in the best format, all the info I think you need is\nthere, it just got scattered a bit, and don&#39;t be too scared of the\nPermissions part, it&#39;s just there so someone can&#39;t sue me when the program\ncrashes :)  I&#39;ve yet to find out if they actually carry any legal weight, ah\nwell.\nBasically all it says is that anyone can use it, and the source code, for\nfree and can&#39;t send me to court if a meteor happens to hit their house the\ninstant they run it :)\n\nThe file is up at www.twarriors.com/deathifier and I&#39;ll upload it to the\nyahoo groups area later on.\n\nAs far as I can tell there are no bugs in it, I ran it over a couple more\nfiles and after some rather odd results and a recompilation it worked fine\nin the exact same tests.  If you do find problems with it please tell me, I\ndon&#39;t like having buggy software out there - typical indications of problems\nare values in objects that don&#39;t make sense, text file lines that don&#39;t get\nread or corruption of text read.  These can sometimes happen if you exceed\nlimits the actual game imposes.\n\nI would have liked it to be more robust, but since the code that needs the\nrobustness isn&#39;t going to end up in the final scenario editor I decided it\ncan live as is.  If there&#39;s some specific feature you want let me know as\nwell, I listed a couple in the documentation file that might be useful if\nyou have lots of problems adding objects.\n\nAnyways I hope this helps with the tournament scenario design and scenario\ndesign in general.\n\nCya&#39;s,\nDeathifier\n\n\n"}}
