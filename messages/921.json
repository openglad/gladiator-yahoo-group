I don&#39;t know how to best say this, but here&#39;s my attempt:\n\nSomehow, while playing through gladiator scenarios, I managed to cause \nthe saved game file to lose track of scenarios I have gone through.  I \nhave already emailed Tom Ricket the saved game and he could not reason \nout how it happenned.  I am not revealing any more information than \nthat.\n\nI, also, want to take time to remind potential tournament players that \n altering the saved game file used for the tournament is considered \ncheating and any person caught doing that will be immediately expelled \nfrom the tournament.\n\n\n"}}
