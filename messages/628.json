As you see, Tower, Golem, and Orc ne=\r\ned more \n&gt; abilities, especially tower.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have two problems with this,=\r\n the latter one the more important:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I think there should have to be=\r\n a set # of abilities for each \ncharacter, \n&gt; either 3 or 4, and that each =\r\ncharacter should have only one ability \nwith an \n&gt; alternate because as it =\r\nis an Archer has 3 abilities while a Cleric \nhas 7.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) A major problem=\r\n with this is that whenever we add abilities to \nGhost, \n&gt; Skeleton or Elem=\r\nental we&#39;re giving just as big a boost to Clerics, \nMages and \n&gt; Archmages,=\r\n the 3 strongest characters (I don&#39;t include faerie on \nthis list \n&gt; becaus=\r\ne druid&#39;s are due for a boost anyway). there are 3 ways of \ndealing \n&gt; with=\r\n this. we could:\n&gt;    A) get rid of all summon abilities except summon faer=\r\nie and \nsummon image. \n&gt; This would also help solve the 1st problem but wou=\r\nld seriously \ncripple an \n&gt; interesting type of ability\n&gt;    B) leave Eleme=\r\nntal, Ghost and Skeleton as they were in the last \ngame, \n&gt; make them unhir=\r\neable or really cheap second tear characters\n&gt;    C) create 2 types of Elem=\r\nentals, Ghosts and Skeletons, a &#39;normal&#39; \ntype \n&gt; (new one) and a &#39;summoned=\r\n&#39; type (old one) this one is my preference \nbecause \n&gt; it keeps the new abi=\r\nlities but doesn&#39;t strengthen the already \ntoo-strong \n&gt; characters. The pr=\r\noblem with this is that it complicates things for \nnew \n&gt; players to have 2=\r\n types of the same character running around.\n&gt; \n&gt; on my excel file i also i=\r\nnclude info about the group three \ncharacters which \n&gt; i won&#39;t include here=\r\n cuz it takes up too much room. But i think that \nthe \n&gt; rule about having =\r\n3-4 abilities per character should apply to them \ntoo. i \n&gt; will start here=\r\n with my goblin:\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 1: suicidal charge*: doubles your attack and s=\r\npeed for the \nduration. \n&gt; at the end of the attack you die. if you finish =\r\nthe level in the \nmiddle of \n&gt; the attack you survive\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 2: taunt:=\r\n like thief but without reverse\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 3: battle cry: adds to your hp =\r\n(the # of team members x your \nlevel)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1 problem with having so many ne=\r\nw characters is that all the choices \nwill \n&gt; confuse newbee&#39;s, so maybe yo=\r\nu should only start with the ability to \nhire \n&gt; characters that are availa=\r\nble in the unregistered version and get a \nnew \n&gt; character every 1 or 2 le=\r\nvels.\n&gt; \n&gt; i don&#39;t thing the practical mage or high priest characters are a=\r\n \ngood idea \n&gt; because again they are improving an already too good charact=\r\ner type. \nOn the \n&gt; other hand something like assassin (from thief) would b=\r\ne very good. \ni would \n&gt; have nothing against practical mage being a hired =\r\ncharacter class. \nAssassin: \n&gt; throws knives like a thief\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 1: dr=\r\nop caltraps: like drop bomb only deals less damage and \nis \n&gt; permanent, de=\r\naling damage to everyone who steps in the square. You \ncould \n&gt; program npc=\r\n&#39;s not to go around a square with them because they were \nvery \n&gt; hard to s=\r\nee.\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 2: cloak: same as thief\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 3: Pick lock: opens any=\r\n door\n&gt; \n&gt; attack 4: back stab: only works when invisible (cloaked or potio=\r\nn); \ndoubles \n&gt; the attack for 1 attack then he looses his invisibility (ma=\r\nybe only \nif he \n&gt; was cloaked)\n&gt; \n&gt; Now the programming project:\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadl=\r\ny, I have absolutely no knowledge of any programming languages \nbut as i \n&gt;=\r\n said before i can be a tester. i don&#39;t have much experience with \nthat eit=\r\nher \n&gt; but i know quite a few people that have played glad before  who \ncou=\r\nld test \n&gt; it as well.  I also have an unused web page on homestead that we=\r\n \ncould use \n&gt; to put up the editor on-line.\n&gt; \n&gt; if we do make G:BF i coul=\r\nd help with the nonprograming designing.\n&gt; \n&gt; This was the longest letter i=\r\n&#39;ve ever written to this group. i hope \nto be \n&gt; very active for the next m=\r\nonth but then i&#39;m going to America for a \nmonth and \n&gt; may not be able to g=\r\net web access very much (poor country, you \nknow).\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _,.-~=3D&#39;*&quot;`^=\r\n^`&quot;*&#39;=3D~-.,_,.-~=3D&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=3D~-.,_,.-~=3D&#39;*&quot;`^^`&quot;*&#39;=3D~-.,_\n&gt; =A4=BA=B0=\r\n`=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8=B8,=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8=B8=\r\n,=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=A4=F8,=B8=B8,=F8=A4=BA=B0`=B0=BA=\r\n=A4=F8,=B8\n&gt; -Terry\n&gt; \n&gt; \n_________________________________________________=\r\n_____________________\n___\n&gt; Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail =\r\nat \nhttp://www.hotmail.com.\n\n\n"}}
