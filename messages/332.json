That way you can always bring in &#39;reinforcements&#39; and \nmake sure to spend the extra money on intelligence for that archmage.\n\n&gt;And whos \n&gt; the overall-WORST charicter in the game? \nThat is my question.  It might be faeries.  On the other hand, it \nmight be Golems.  Yep, I have been playing around with a Golem while \nplay testing and at measily level 7, I could not get him to use up his \nmagic power, except by freezing time.\n\nThat leads me to an interesting question:  Should a character&#39;s \nabsolute strength be judged at least partially by the character&#39;s \nability to use up magic power as fast as possible with an attack?  I \nmean what good is all the magic power in the world, if a character can \nnot use it up.  I mean I have trouble using up the magic power of some \nof the images summoned by my mega-archmage (level 256).\n\n\n"}}
