Do you ever see ninjas in a fantasy novel? No. That&#39;s because most medieval fantasy novels launch from 12th century Europe. Ninjas come from Japan.\nNow, are you talking the funny little japanese guys that run around in black clothing, with ninja stars and katanas and in general are amazing fighters, thieves and assassins?\nIf you want to be an assassin, (working for the Saervii or for Jakarta) I need a physical description, skills and a general attitude. If you can&#39;t give me more than a 1 sentence answer, I have to make one up.\n\n-Trahern\n\n-- \n\n_______________________________________________\r\nTalk More, Pay Less with Net2Phone Direct(R), up to 1500 minutes free! \r\nhttp://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?143 \r\n\r\n\n\n"}}
