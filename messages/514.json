Like George said, it&#39;s a good place to\nstay informed about new maps and stuff.  \n\nBefore we get too far into planning some sort of tournament, it might be\na good idea to take an interest survey.  I mean,  if only two people\nwant to participate, is it still worth doing?  While I do find time to\nreply to some of these posts occasionally, I kind of doubt I would have\nthe time to actually participate.  By the way Daniel, how many people\nare subscribed to this list out of curiousity?\nI suspect I would play gladiator more often if I had people to play\nwith, because that&#39;s what I remember being really fun about it, sitting\ndown with a friend or two and trying to get through the game.  I know I\nwould play more if there were some sort of network capabilities, since I\nhave a home network and am alwayse looking for stuff that will work on a\np200 that&#39;s fun multiplayer.\n\nI wonder how hard it would be to make a linux version . . .  if only\nthey would hook us with the source code.  : �\n\n"}}
