We \njust \n&gt; need to generate the terrain and the dudes.\n&gt; \n&gt; I set up the forms neccesary to allow the user to have control over \n&gt; what type of characters (living family) to place in the scenario \n[so \n&gt; you could randomly populate with just soldiers or with golems and \n&gt; towers] and what types of treasures (treasure family) to place in \nthe \n&gt; scenario.  I plan on running a test pretty soon to ensure the code \nfor \n&gt;  the randoming choosing works in coordination with the forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, I finally found the one section of source code I \n&gt; have been hunting: the code [ void viewscreen::view_team(short \nleft, \n&gt; short top, short right, short bottom) ] that controls the display \nof \n&gt; team stats while you are playing a scenario.  I plan on doing \n&gt; calculations to readjust the spacing of information in the table \nafter \n&gt; I study that section of code for a while.  When I think I have it \n&gt; right to make the spacing work, I&#39;ll email to you guys. [I am going \nto \n&gt; summon a fire elemental since his stats take up the most space and \nuse \n&gt; that to determine how to readjust the spacing to prevent overlap.]\n\n\n"}}
