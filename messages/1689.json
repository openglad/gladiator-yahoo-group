There is no \nREAL \n&gt; purpose for towers, but they could be interesting at one point if \n&gt; triggers were added.\n\nGood points made. The size of the towers would probably only make the \ngame slightly more realistic, but that&#39;s no harm is it? The fact they \ncan&#39;t move makes them pretty useless.\n\n&gt; Golems are interesting creatures for the game, the problem being \n&gt; their size. Almost any level has a spot where a golem could not get \n&gt; to.\n\nThat&#39;s not the only problem. For a laugh, I changed one of my team \nchars into a Golem, and when it got to the next level it was trapped \nwith another team member.\n\n&gt; Truely I think golems should be summoned as the Master Druid \n&gt; spell (level 15 or something). They are too big for regular levels.\n\n...Shame I didn&#39;t think of that.\n \n&gt; --- In gladiator@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Daniel Paul Hightower \n&gt; &lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt;&quot; &lt;dph_of_rules@u...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Yea, this week, we are talking about Golems and Towers.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let&#39;s hear the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n\n"}}
