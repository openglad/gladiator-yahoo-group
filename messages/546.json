I just sent an email requesting those vital info on scenario file \nformats.  \nThere were a few things I conceded about building a new program:  \n  There would probably have to be password protection on said program \nsimiliar to the original.  Zipped file requires a pssword to unzip.\n  If there was legal documents to be signed to create a new scenario \neditor, all involved in creating a new one would have to sign \ndocuments.\n\n\n"}}
