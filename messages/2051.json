I can get free webspace since I am an application reviewer at illusionfxnet.com. Also, does anyone know how to edit .pix files?

(Using Borland)\n\nMeh, I was hoping that open-glad would use bmp files so I could try adding new classes. Maybe someone can add multiplayer to it, I dunno.\n\n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?  Yahoo!
