Once I&#39;m hit the second time \nwhile being frozen from the first hit, I might as well be down for the \ncount.  Basically, any exp level 1 faerie becomes a high level threat \nto any mages/archmages on my team.  So that translates to saying any \ndruid capable of summoning faeries is a high level threat. (For real \nfun, go through my Weakest Link II from dph&#39;s scenarios with a high \nlevel mage; you better hit the ground running if you don&#39;t want to get \nfrozen by a faerie.)\n\n[Side note: I really like being able to point to a specific \nscenario(s) to illustrate a point.]\n\n\n"}}
