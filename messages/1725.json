However, unless you are holding down \nF8+M+shifter constantly while controlling them, it&#39;s hard to put \nChain Lightning to such use that it becomes unbalanced.\n\nAs for Mind Control, it just never works. Summon Elemental is by far \nthe most powerful move in the game; summon the most dangerous type of \ncharacter in all of existence to help you out a bit. Maybe that and \nthe might of Elementals are what makes an archmage so terrifying.\n\nA complicated analysis would say that archmages, although not as \neffective as some other classes in direct battle, are the most \npowerful because they can summon the most feared enemies in the game.\n\nNow I will move on to clerics.\n\nHealing is one of the best moves in the game (unless it&#39;s a god-duel, \nin which case you have nobody to heal), but there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve \nnever been able to work out. If they can heal others, why can&#39;t they \nheal themselves? Also, unless they have very good guards or a lot of \nblood around so they can raise their own, clerics die slightly too \nquickly.\n\nYes, you are licensed to post your views.\n\n\n"}}
