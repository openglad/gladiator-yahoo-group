I expect\n&gt; all the only things put there to be screen shots.  If I find certain\n&gt; other things which I consider offensive in the Photos area, I will\n&gt; restrict access to who can upload to that area.  Unfortunately, both\n&gt; Files and Photos share the same settings for access controls.\n\nHeh, the usual thing I see when someone discoveres a photo section is\nsomeone asking everyone to upload pics of themselves...\nThankfully the people here are somewhat saner than those in other online\ngroups :)\n\n&gt; Is there a general way to get complete pictures of maps without using\n&gt; the print screen method?\n\nMaybe, the scenario editor we will someday build will need to load and\ndisplay the map so you can edit it, so obviously you could grab screenshots\nfrom that.\nOnly thing is I don&#39;t know how you&#39;d go about doing that.  If we had some\ndetails about where the map data is and where we load the images from\nsomeone should be able to throw at least a scenario file -&gt; map image (but\nnot the other way, heh) converter up and we could use it in the scenario\neditor later.\n\nOther than that, doubt it, the minimap doesn&#39;t show the entire map and it&#39;s\nthe only thing that gives you a large-area view...\n\nJust for fun I added a map image export feature to the scenario editors\nfeature list :)\n\n- Deathifier\n\n\n"}}
