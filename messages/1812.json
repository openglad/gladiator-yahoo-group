I found one scenario without a link to the next \none.  I decided to upgrade the doors of &quot;Master Slime&quot; (#158) and also \nadd lots more blood to the scenario so that clerics can raise more \nskeletons.  It&#39;s amazing how my team wants to attack the slime in \n&quot;Master Slime&quot;, but had to be dragged in attacking the slime in &quot;The \nSlime King&quot; (#156).  I decided to help give those archers a fighting \nchance in &quot;The Port City&quot; (#124) and I may do more work on the golem \nso it has a fighting chance on its own instead of being a liability.\n\nMy elf had a big coming out party during my hedge scenarios (117, 120, \n121, 122) :-) .  I was really thrilled about how well my team handled \n&quot;The Escaped Prisoners&quot; (#157) and &quot;the Castle Defenses&quot; (#159) :-) . \n I was suprised how the NPC help had more mana and health available \nthan some of my team members with higher experience levels.\n\nI&#39;m relieved that my team surived &quot;Battle of the Gods&quot; (#162) without \ngetting hurt (I was worried they&#39;d open the doors and clear the \nforest quickly enough to fight in the battle).  Good thing I put all \nthose blood spots around.  At the same time, I admit being scared of \n&quot;the End of Extreme Island&quot;.  [I&#39;m not worried at all about the last \ntwo.]\n\nYou guys are wrong, there were a couple of scenarios I completed in my \nset without any teammates gaining an experience level.  It was quite \ninteresting earning enough money to buy a level 40 character after \nbeating a scenario.\n\nI&#39;m slightly concerned that right now, it&#39;s impossible for my \nbarbarian to use up his mana, while the rest of my team has potential \nproblems with having enough mana.  I&#39;m still upset about his aiming \nsystem. (Why in the heck does the barbarian have such a bad tendacy to \naim both hurl boulder and exploding boulder incorrectly when firing \nstraight, but achieves perfect accuracy when aiming diagonally?)\n\n\n"}}
