Last night, I eliminated one \nbug and set things up to eliminate the bigger bug.  Note: you&#39;ll \nprobably have to guide me through the steps to upload a new file.  But \nthat will be after Saturday.\n\n \n&gt; In related news, I got the pix editor fully functional today. I \nwould have done it several days ago, but I&#39;ve been extremely busy. Its \nnot userfriendly, but it can zoom, skip through frames, and edit? This \npixie editor can be used to edit any .pix file. So any artists out \nthere, you can have at it :-). Download the latest from CVS, compile, \nand you&#39;re ready to go.\n\ncool.\n\n\n"}}
