I&#39;ll visit a scenario and no \nopponents will appear, even though I have not beaten it.  I have to \nfind a scenario that the game thinks I haven&#39;t beat, exit Gladiator, \nthen run Gladiator and go back to that scenario in order to play it.\n\nOther notes: 300 (experience level 9) druids around do not \nsignificantly produce more fearies than 150 (experience level 9) \ndruids.  The only thing is the druids block the path of faeries when I \nuse a thief to taunt them.  I haven&#39;t tried using a soldier or an \narcher to beat the scenario I am playing around with.  What I am \ntrying to produce is a way for non-Archmages and non-Thieves to gain \nlots of experience.  I use slimes to give Archmages lots of experience \nand I use tents to give thieves lots of experience.\n\nHere&#39;s another thought: what if we could, when creating a scenario, \nspecify what abilities opponents could and could not use.  That way I \ncould put a high level mage around, but take away the ability to \nfreeze time.  Or put a high-level archmage around, and prevent him \nfrom accessing chain-lightning.\n\n\n"}}
