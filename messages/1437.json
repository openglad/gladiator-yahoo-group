I&#39;ve been meaning to\n&gt; make master versions of the Levels.001 and\n&gt; Graphics.001 once we&#39;ve worked out what are &quot;accepted&quot;\n&gt; fan-made scenarios and what the titles will be.\n&gt; Unfortunately, you can&#39;t add to a .001 file, so first\n&gt; you need to unpack all the old stuff and make entirely\n&gt; new Graphics.001 and Levels.001 files, and there are a\n&gt; LOT of graphics files that can only be extracted one\n&gt; at a time.\n\nOpenGlad-0.1 contains all the pix files in unpacked form (I think that&#39;s\nall of them at least).
