I&#39;ll mention that request in the moderator&#39;s group.  Since one\nof the guys is on vacation, that group has not had any messages posted\nbecause every message requires moderator approval.  That limit seems\nkind of silly, but it is probably the same limit on files you can send\nas attachements.\n\n\n\nThe Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\nYour use of Yahoo!
