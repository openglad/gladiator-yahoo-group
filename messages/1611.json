Maybe shuffle in some good music, some in-game chat engine, work on some of the graphics, and boom, this game could almost go market :)  well anyway, like I said, I&#39;m not even sure of the limits of C++, and whether or not it even has the capability of doing things like this, but I would surely like to know.\n   Oh, and if it is so, I might just have to pick up a c++ manual and begin serious work on this as well...   Hope to hear from you.\n\n     -Shig\n  From: Zardus@... \n  To: gladiator@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, January 09, 2003 1:15 AM\n  Subject: [gladiator] Openglad 0.97\n\n\n  One hour ago, Openglad 0.97 was released into the wild! This new version\n  is a bugfix release, so anyone who had been having trouble with Openglad\n  should upgrade to this.\n\n  The list of changes for this version is:\n\n    - The plugging of an extremely nasty memory leak (that could leak a meg\n      every few minutes) in the foe finding code. As far as I can tell, that\n      leak has been in the code ever since the foe finding code was written,\n      which would make this a pretty dang long-lived memory leak. Other\n      sizable leaks were plugged too, but I forgot the details on those.\n    - For those who had trouble with fullscreen in Windows, it should\n      hopefully work now. For once, the windows binaries were released at\n      the same time as the Linux ones, so you can go ahead and try it out\n      whenever you want. There is still no working joystick support for\n      Windows, and as soon as I can get USB configured in my Windows\n      emulator prog, I&#39;ll get to working on that.\n    - A long list of crashes was fixed, too long to remember :-)\n    - File finding code was improved. It properly checks the current\n      directory now.\n    - All the required files are now included in the distribution (this\n      should fix the missing DLL errors some windows users were having).\n      The docs are also in there.\n\n  The new release can be downloaded from http://snowstorm.sourceforge.net,\n  or through the project site (http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowstorm).\n  This time, the source comes in both tar.gz and zip format, so Windows\n  users can use the .zip without making WinZip choke on the tar.gz format.\n  There is a makefile for VC in case anyone wants to work on the source code\n  a bit. Openglad can be compiled by executing &quot;nmake /f Makefile.vc&quot; in the\n  src/ directory.\n\n  It is very well possible that the fixes messed up working stuff, so if\n  anyone finds any bugs whatsoever (there are no known ones at the time of\n  this writing), please submit a bug report (at\n  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=50083&atid=458515).\n\n  That&#39;s that for Openglad 0.97. Most of the changes I noted above were done\n  in the last 4 days or so. Over the last few months, me and Sean have been\n  working on Openglad Enhanced. We&#39;re currently working on cleaning up the\n  code to make the whole thing easier to work with, and as soon as school\n  lays off a bit, we&#39;ll be able to go at a much quickker pace, so hopefully\n  there will be great things for Openglad in the future.\n\n\n  That&#39;s it for now. Enjoy the new release!\n\n  - Yan\n\n\n  The Gladiator Mailing List\n\n\n  Your use of Yahoo! Groups is subject to the Yahoo!
