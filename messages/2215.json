I know spending more time with slimes \nand respawn creatures helps.  Character success shouldn&#39;t depend on \nwhether players spend time expoliting the XP system.\n\nAny other factors? \n\nAlso, in multiplayer mode, the most powerful team player gets an XP \nmomentum which the other players can&#39;t keep up with.  (not fun/fair)\n\nA simple way to stabilize XP buildup would be to assign a cash and \nXP value for each level.  No XP or cash for killing creatures. Cash \npickups around the level would still be fine.  That way, level \ndesigners would know exactly how much XP, cash (and power) a team \nhas before they start the next level!  Not to mention how much \neasier it will be to balance the class and XP system.\n\nI&#39;m not sure exactly how the xp should be divided among the team.\nMaybe divide 2/3 of the XP evenly among the surviving players, and \n1/3 of the XP evenly among the surviving npc&#39;s.\n\nPool team cash normally.\nAn number representing fair share should be displayed on the cash \nallocation screen, but not enforced.\n\nfair_share = total_cash_from_level / #_of_team_players;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
