It would make tower-defended doorways more\n&gt; perilous.\n\nAdmittedly, trying to get between the tower-defended doorways in my \n&quot;Release of Sun Bai&quot; is dangerous; one could argue that&#39;s because of \nthe experience level.\n\n&gt; I also think that towers should perhaps be\n more resilient to missile attacks, so that people need\n to get close in order to destroy them. \n\nEvery character should have a weakness.\n\n&gt;Towers, as they are, are weak against mages and archers.\n\nor elves on the other side of a forest.\n\n\n"}}
