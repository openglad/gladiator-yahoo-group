(forgive my reducing everything to base level and explaining\n&gt;every detail, but I have no idea how much you know....) ....if this is the\n&gt;case...make sure you&#39;ve saved yer scenario...it will ask you to name\n&gt;it.....I think...(think is the key word) that the level will load first\n&gt;rather than the level in the levels.001....but if you havnt renamed the\n&gt;level AND the grid to scen99 it will only load the one you&#39;ve saved as the\n&gt;actual scen99 (naming means pressing &quot;n&quot; then &quot;s&quot; (for scene) and &quot;g&quot; (for\n&gt;grid)...you gotta do both)\n&gt;if you know all this and you are mr. Programmer in disguise and know all\n&gt;this stuff already then just ignore me....if not..I hope I have helped....\n&gt;-max\n\nLet&#39;s see.  It sounds like Max has got it pretty much covered.  So rather than\ntry to cover things in depth, I&#39;ll list (or re-state) things you can do to\ncheck your levels:\n\n1)      Make sure you&#39;ve re-named both the &#39;scene&#39; and &#39;grid&#39; halves of the\nlevel, as Max mentioned.  Both the names are listed on the right side of the\nscenario editor; make sure they both show up as something different from the\ndefault.  The &#39;scene&#39; part MUST be named something like &quot;scenX,&quot; where X is\nthe\nlevel number (scen1, scen10, scen105, etc).  The &#39;grid&#39; part can actually be\nnamed anything you want (mygrid, tom99, etc.), but you might want to make it\nmatch the &#39;scene&#39; name.  Most importantly, it shouldn&#39;t be &quot;test&quot; (the\ndefault)\nor &quot;scen0001&quot; or whatever level you have loaded.\n        So, for a test level number 138, I&#39;d probably name both scene and grid\n&quot;scen138&quot;.\n\n2)      After you&#39;ve saved (or think you&#39;ve saved) your scenario, from a DOS\nprompt or Windows window, see if you have two new files: a .FSS file and a\n.PIX\nfile.  These should be &quot;scene.FSS&quot; and &quot;grid.PIX&quot; to match the example above. \nSo using the above examples, you should have &quot;scen138.FSS&quot; and &quot;scen138.PIX&quot;\nfiles added.  If you don&#39;t, this is where the problem is coming in.\n\n3)      If the level doesn&#39;t load correctly in Gladiator, try re-loading it\nusing the scenario editor.  If it doesn&#39;t load correctly there, either,\nthen it\nprobably wasn&#39;t saved correctly.  This may mean that your &quot;GLAD.CFG&quot; file\ndoesn&#39;t have the correct information entered in it; you can correct this by\nre-running Gladiator&#39;s SETUP.EXE program, and specifying the correct drive\nletter and path.  Remember that Gladiator is a DOS (not Windows) based\ngame, so\nthat folder/directory names (a) can&#39;t have spaces or funny characters in them,\nand (b) must be 8 letters or fewer in length.  So installing Gladiator to:\n&quot;C:&#92;Program Files&#92;My Games&#92;Gladiator&quot; will not work, while\n&quot;C:&#92;Files&#92;Games&#92;Glad&quot; will work fine.\n        You can also see where the scenario editor THINKS it is installed by\nadding &quot;/?&quot; when running it (that is, type &quot;scen /?&quot; at the command line.  It\nwill print out something like this:\n        Scenario Editor version 3.8H\n        Using Data directory: e:&#92;gladr&#92;\n        NOTE: this is set in glad.cfg.\n        Memory available: 130019328 bytes.\n\nIf the &quot;data directory&quot; is incorrect, that&#39;s where the problem is occuring. \nYou can fix this by re-running setup.exe, or by editing the GLAD.CFG file\nusing\na text editor.\n\nThat&#39;s all I can think of for now .. hope it helps!\n\n--Tom\n\n \n\n---------------------------- \nTom Ricket \n&lt;mailto:tricket@...&gt;mailto:tricket@... \nForgotten Sages Games \n&lt;http://www.fsgames.com&gt;http://www.fsgames.com \n---------------------------- \n\n\n\n\n"}}
