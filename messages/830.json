Im the whacko who posted\n&gt; my loud opinion a few months ago.\n&gt; Well with school finally finished I&#39;ve been working on\n&gt; my own novel, and for the past day or two I sat down\n&gt; and started working on the fanfic I promised for\n&gt; Gladiator.\n&gt;\n&gt; Since I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to post files\n&gt; onto the gladiator group, I&#39;ll give you the link to\n&gt; the webspace where I&#39;ve got it stuck at.\n&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.angelfire.com/rpg/zjackrum&quot;&gt;Click\n&gt; here to go to my webpage&lt;/a&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s nothing special because I&#39;m an English major, not\n&gt; a programmer. I don&#39;t want to give too much away, but\n&gt; I took the three guys I see most on the forum and used\n&gt; your names for characters in the book. I hope I dont\n&gt; disapoint anybody.\n&gt; I mention Tom Ricket in there too. He should be happy,\n&gt; because he&#39;s obtained God status!\n&gt; And a late apology to Deathifier, who I saw post\n&gt; yesterday, but isn&#39;t in the story yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Check it out and post feedback to me, or through the\n&gt; forum. Thanks.\n&gt; -Trahern\n&gt; --\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________________________\n&gt; Make PC-to-Phone calls with Net2Phone.\n&gt; Sign-up today at: http://www.net2phone.com/cgi-bin/link.cgi?121\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Gladiator Mailing List\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your use of Yahoo!
