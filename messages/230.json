Can\n&gt;someone at FS Games explains how this little bug works?\n\nSure -- when we put doors into the game, we wanted to make sure there was \nalways *some* way around them -- that is, if we really wanted to block an \narea, we&#39;d use a &quot;real&quot; blocker of some kind.\n\nThe thought was that, say, there was a key hidden in the southwest corner \nof a map. If, for some reason, the player just *couldn&#39;t* get it, for some \nreason, we didn&#39;t want them to give up.  So we made doors work basically \nlike &quot;really high hitpoint&quot; creatures.  Generally (unless you&#39;re using \nboosted characters) it takes more work to destroy a door by force than just \nby finding the darn key.  But if you really want to just blow the darn \nthing up, you can.\n\n&gt;3rd, Can someone at FS Games tell me the specific limitations on how\n&gt;much strength, dex, con, intelligence, and experience are the maximum?\n&gt;  I want to make sure I do NOT design a level too close to those\n&gt;extremes.\n\nGenerally, each character stat uses a signed 16-big integer.  That means \nthe larger number in those areas is going to be about 32,767.\n\nHowever, remember that the stats interact with each other.  For example \n(and this isn&#39;t a real formula we use), let&#39;s say that &quot;bonus points&quot; \nassigned to a character are equal to:\n         STR / 4         +               INT / 2         +       DEX\n\n.. or something like that.  That means when your values get near the top \n(especially if the formulas contain &quot;multiplies&quot; in them), you&#39;ll suddenly \nwrap from having 32,725 or so &quot;Bonus points&quot; to having some low, or even \nnegative, number. (Sometimes all &lt;0 numbers are considered 0; sometimes \nthey&#39;re treated as normal negative numbers).\n\n&gt;   I have also noticed that when a level 255 archmage summons\n&gt;a fire elemental, the elemental&#39;s health and magic power are listed\n&gt;as  negative numbers.  Can someone as FS Games explain this one?\n\nBasically, the above answer: the elemental&#39;s values are set based on its \nowners; some part of the formula which determines how powerful it is ends \nup &quot;looping&quot; over the maximum value.\n\n--Tom\n\n\n"}}
