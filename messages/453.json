For example, I&#39;ll have a \ncharacter run toward a foe, shooting his weapon, and suddenly back off just \nbefore I run into him. The shots build up behind you, and as the enemy walks \nstraight toward you, they hit him all at once like a ton of bricks. Brutal.\n\nEver notice how druids open doors faster than any other profession? Just \nimagine a druid planting a tree IN a door, its roots twisting through the \nframework and tearing at the hinges...\n\nChain lightning is a big problem for me. My old computer would freeze when I \nused it on too many foes; my newer one simply slows down to the point where \nit would take days for the lightning to run its course. On the one hand, if \nyou&#39;re afraid to let a big chain lightning rip, it kinda brings down the \nincongruous power of the archmage... on the other, it&#39;s a plague on \nplayability. If anything needs revision, I think this is it. A limit on the \nnumber of separate lightning bolts, maybe fifty, would be the most \nappropriate fix. Heh, if all these suggestions were implemented the game \nprobably wouldn&#39;t run half as smoothly, so we should probably just accept \nwhat we have.\n     -Tevildo, Prince of Cats.\n_________________________________________________________________\nGet your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer.msn.com\n\n\n"}}
