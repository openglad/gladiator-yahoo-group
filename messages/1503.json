The bug was\nthat the AI would pick a victim in the beginning of the level and go\nrelentlessly after him/her until it (the ai) was attacked by someone\nelse.\n\nMany a night has been spent trying to find the source of this bug, and\njust now Odo suggested that I try the dos binary for 3.8k. I tried it, and\nit turns out AI behaves that way there as well.\n\nNow, most of my Gladiator memories come from 3.8G, which I&#39;ve played for\nyears, but the AI in 3.8G is much more easy going. For example, the elves\non the first level walk around the edges of the map instead of\nslaughtering your guys like madmen.\n\nDoes anyone know for sure how the AI was designed to act, or at least how\nyou guys expect it to act? The Snowstorm team will sleep easier at night\nknowing that there are no AI bugs in Openglad (or at least be prepared if\nthere _are_ bugs in there).\n\n- Zardus\n\n\n"}}
