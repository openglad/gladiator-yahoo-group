How joyful was I\nwhen I found Gladiator still alive on the &#39;net, and even more happy to\nsee that it&#39;s been released under the GPL (as OpenGlad).  But oh woe,\nto my utter despair, scen-edit STILL gives the same error!  THAT WAS\nWHY I LIKED GLADIATOR SO MUCH!  I like creating levels; you should&#39;ve\nseen me on ZZT.  I was limited by a tiny hard drive on my old\ncomputer; I&#39;d love to use it on a 160GB one.  I could make BILLIONS of\nmaps!  But why won&#39;t the scenario editor work!?  WHAT FORCES CONSPIRE\nTO KILL MY FUN!!?  I&#39;m okay.. I&#39;m okay.. *sniff*\n\nHere&#39;s the error message:\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v81/ericmelech/opengladerror.png\n\n\n\n"}}
