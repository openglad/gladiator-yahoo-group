(stat wise and game\n&gt; mechanics wise, and theoretically.)  Studied mitosis :) ?\n\nI remember mitosis, but that&#39;s not what happens.\n \n&gt; Like in the first slime battle in the original campaign, if gurgle splits,\n&gt; either half of gurgle that you kill first announces ENEMY DEATH GURGLE\n&gt; KILLED.\n\nI start with a slime called &quot;Revenue&quot;.  After it repeatedly splits, eventually slimes with no name will show up.  Hypothetically,\nall slimes can from &quot;Revenue&quot; so all slimes should have a name, but that doesn&#39;t happen.\n\nMy question is when and why that happens.\n\n\n"}}
