<LI>The moderator does not mind criticism as long as criticism does not become personal.
<LI>No attachements to messages are allowed.
<LI>Sending messages in HTML format is discouraged.
<LI>Posting announcements about a new group of scenarios is allowed/encouraged and the moderator loves to go through new scenarios.
